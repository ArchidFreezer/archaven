    <p>Sawbones, the most painfully-misunderstood (and thus probably the most underrated) class in the game. In fact, a poll had 25% of people calling this class underpowered (the 4th highest percentage of votes for 'underpowered' in the game). People who think this class is underpowered think so because they believe that it's a support class. But Saw is only tangentially a support class. Saw gets to support as a bonus, but Saw is really an excellent melee damage-dealer with an incredible capacity for crowd control.</p>
    <p>Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.</p>
