   <p>The mindthief is a powerful melee character who lays down large amounts of CC and can lock down enemies with stun, using <i>Ice</i>.</p> <p>This build is for Guildmaster mode where we need to keep a summon around to get one of our perks.</p>
    <p>So why would you play a Guildmaster Build?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Powerful damage dealer from melee at the start and then adding ranged options</li>
      <li>Significant CC</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Guildmaster build loves the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Part member who can tank rooms or draw aggro</li>
      <li>Some form of healing and support</li>

              <p>The top is a decent loss action. It won't get used very often because your non-loss actions are so strong, it's typically not worth playing losses, but it certainly comes up in the last room a reasonable amount of the time (often paired with Perverse Edge bottom to really turn a fight).</p>
              <hr>
              <p>But the bottom is where the meat of this card resides. Move 2, Heal 2 self is really important for this class as YOU WILL TAKE DAMAGE, that's just a fact of life for a rat. So having some free healing that you add in here and there will make sure you're healthy enough to survive what you need to survive when the hits do come.</p>

              <p>Now Empathetic Assault is a card!<p>The excellent initiative of this card compounds an already quite good bottom move action and makes it exceptional.</p><p>Finally, while we will discuss enhancements overall at the end of the guide, the biggest draw of this card is its enhancement dot next to the Heal action on bottom. The assumption that you will absolutely make a certain enhancement there is the reason this card is so good.</p></p>

              <p>First of all, it's 'just' an Attack 4 that gives 1 XP from level 1 onward. And as the Mindthief has some great level-ups, especially later on, XP definitely matters. But the card doesn't stop there. Push 3 is actually huge. It's not immediately obvious, but Push 3 is actually soooo much better than other classes' Push 2's. Push 2 can often put enemies into traps, but Push 3 almost always can. It's extremely easy to trigger traps with this card in any scenario that has non-flying enemies and traps. And as traps scale incredibly well with levels, this card also scales wonderfully.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, the bottom isn't especially impressive as a Move 4, Attack 4 as again, you don't really want to play losses and we have better ones, but it can get you two XP at the end of a scenario.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Fearsome Blade is sneakily incredible.<p>Even up through level 9, I will bring this card to any scenario that has damage and/or Stun traps (obviously traps without either of these two effects don't scale so well).</p></p>

              <p>Feedback Loop essentially doesn't have a top for normal play (although it is technically possible with the right allies to setup a rather hilarious tanking build on this class, but I wouldn't recommend that to any first-time players).</p>
              <hr>
              <p>And the bottom has a lot of text to basically just tell you it's a Move 4 with Jump.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Speaking of cards with late initiative.<p>So on a class stacked with good cards, how good is a Move 4 with Jump? Well, with a different initiative, it wouldn't be particularly impressive. But Feedback Loop is a hidden all-star just because of the 79 initiative. The Mindthief actually gets a ton of great early initiative but truly lacks late initiative. Late initiative is extremely important on this class for two reasons: you're a squishy often-melee class, so you want to be able to run into the enemies after they've acted, not before. In addition to that, you have non-loss Invis at levels 1 and 9, which you typically want to follow with a late initiative. Thus, Feedback Loop, a card that doesn't seem nearly as splashy as others like Perverse Edge or Frigid Apparition, actually keeps them company until we find a replacement at level 3.</p></p>

              <p>Even without Ice, this is your highest damage non-loss attack, which already makes it pretty good (a non-conditional attack 5 non-loss at level 1, where do I sign up?) But then adding Stun on top of it really makes this card incredible.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom loss is decent but not great. You won't ever be pulled to use it, both because it's not very powerful and you don't want to lose this top action, but sometimes it will end up mattering and you'll use it.</p>

              <p>Well, melee summons are pretty bad (because they typically run into harm's way and take unnecessary damage that you'd otherwise avoid with movement), Move 2 on this one makes it unlikely to contribute much once we start to move. Still, at level 1, the stats are pretty decent and sometimes it will be worth bringing it out in the middle of the fray. Unusually, this summons is not a persistent loss so has much more value than normal and so can be used as a meat shield in combat as well as the standard use of late in the round to get a go the next round early.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>A late move 4 is always good on a level 1 card.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>This card being a Move 4 with another late initiative is still actually quite good at level 1.<p>Because we want the bottom so much, it doesn't really matter that the top loss is highly situational, because we can just spam the bottom most of the time and if we ever want the top, it will be there at essentially no opportunity cost. The biggest strike against this card is that we already have Feedback Loop, which adds Jump at the cost of having 3 worse initiative, which is a very good trade.</p></p>

              <p>The bottom also great Invisibility is sort of a naturally broken mechanic in Gloomhaven (both for personal damage avoidance and more often for completely ruining monster AI by creating moving obstacles that don't have obstacle placement rules) and this instance of it is very free to us. Adding <i>Ice</i> for our stuns is a real bonus.</p>

              <p>Into the Night is a great card that will stay with us as it does lots of little things, all of which are useful.<p>Finally, it's important to mention a significant tactic with Invisible: when you go Invisible, you really want to go early in the round (to avoid enemy actions for that round) and then late in the next round (because the Invisible lasts until the end of your next turn, if you go late the following round, you also avoid enemy actions that round). Fortunately, Into the Night already goes pretty early, so you've got that covered, but that does mean you'll really want to make sure you have another card with late initiative to go the following round (otherwise you can just long rest, but you - or more accurately your allies - don't always want that to be your turn in the middle of combat).</p></p>

              <hr>
              <p>On the bottom, we have an okay action but not great. Think of how hard it is to get an enemy into a trap with Push 1 - this is a bit better, but not by a lot, and having it not attached to a move or anything else makes it pretty poor. A situational effect like this might be alright if it was on a card with another good half, like Scurry, but with the top already being bad, there's really no room for this poor initiative Attack 4 or Move 2.</p>

              <p>The top of Perverse Edge is the upgraded version of Submissive Affliction. Unfortunately, what was good about Submissive Affliction was not being a loss, this attack is pretty bad for a few reasons. First of all, it's not very reliable damage. Secondly, typically enemies with a bunch of conditions are the least important ones to finish off quickly with loss card. Lastly, using the top loss deprives you of your best level 1 bottom action.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>And boy, is this some bottom action.<p>A stun with 8 initiative and you get an Ice to follow up with another Stun next turn on Frigid Apparition. Stunning enemies is the second best thing an action can do in Gloomhaven, aside from just killing them, and you're absolutely going to want to do your best to use this to that effect every rest cycle.</p></p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>In my opinion, this non-loss bottom action makes this into the best starter level 1 card outside of The Mind's Weakness and Reviving Ether. Getting to Stun an enemy with a bottom action while still having your top action to Attack is incredible.<p>We can even increase the range on the bottom or add a Wound to the top attack for a very powerful combo.</p></p>

              <p>So an attack 6 loss would be a decent level 1 loss action, but having an additional positional requirement on top of it makes this top action pretty awful.</p>

              <p>Scurry top is a perfect example of an action which is balanced around the existence of The Mind's Weakness. For any other class, this top action would be pretty bad. For this class, it's excellent, especially at level 1. There's not a lot more to say about this, move 3 attack 3 is just very obviously good.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, Loot 2 is a fine bottom loss for the end of a scenario, if you managed to keep Scurry until then, which will sometimes happen.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>This top will also make it easier to deal with the range limitation on your best bottom action - Perverse Edge (at least until it's enhanced). It also works wonders with Into the Night bottom, letting you move in and make an Attack 3 without any risk afterwards. You can often use this tactic when entering new rooms, especially if you have Boots of Striding to guarantee you can reach a target, but even without you still can just end on the door and go Invisible to blank the round for all melee enemies (if you're the one opening doors with this combo, you should typically tell your allies to go late in the round so the melee enemies go before they do).</p>

              <p>It mostly just reads 'Attack 4, 1 XP' on top, which is still 1 XP better than the default top attack actions you'll end up doing a fair amount of the time at level 1. I'd think of this top text more as an occasional bonus that comes up because of your allies rather than something you want to play around.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is also decent but not exciting for a level 1 bottom. It's basically an attack 2 most of the time, and gets a bit better when there are lots of melee enemies and enemies with Retaliate (or enemies with innate conditions on their Attacks). Still, we'll end up using it a fair amount of the time. And combining pretty good bottom with a pretty good top is quite fine for a level 1 card.</p>

              <p>Submissive Affliction is an above average level 1 card.<p>With regard to the top, even though you have a fair amount of Stun, Stun doesn't really work with this effect because you normally want to Stun an enemy before they go on their turn, so it'll be gone by the next round when you'd attack with this. And your only real source of Muddle at level 1 is the bottom of Feedback Loop which will occasionally come up but realistically you'll want to actually Move 4 with it most of the time. It gets a bit better as we level but not really enough to justify keeping it around for the standard build. Additionally, as you already hit pretty hard, it's not like you really want to do significant extra work just for a bit of extra damage.</p><p>Sadly, the biggest problem with this card is the initiative and being a worse non-move bottom than our Invisibility and Stun, which combined with our need to move often, makes the better half of this card harder to line up consistently.</p></p>

              <p>And here it is, the problem card itself. Well, not a lot to say about this card - while there may be semi-viable builds using the level 5 or the level 9 Augments, most of the time, you're going to have to use this card (after all, most of the Mindthief's melee attack cards are balanced around this effect). So yeah, play it and keep it up.</p>

              <p>Speaking of keeping this up, there is something important to keep track of. Remember that as a persistent non-loss card, you may recover this along with your discarded cards anytime you rest.<p>So as a general rule, in order to help your longevity, you should recover this card anytime you rest where you would otherwise end up with an odd number of cards (so let's say you have 8 cards in your discard pile and this out - if you rest and leave this out, you'll end up with 7 cards in your hand, whereas if you recover this as well, you'll get 8 instead, which gives you a whole extra turn).</p><p>This can be quite important to pay attention to as you will nett a fair number of turns over the course of a scenario. Obviously, if you're in a tough fight where immediate strength is more important than longevity, you can disregard this.</p></p>

          <p>And these are our remaining level 1 cards to choose from. The choices here are unfortunately a bit too easy to make. We're more than happy to add in another Move 4 as we only have one thus far and basically every Gloomhaven class would like to have at least two Move 4's or better as a core build for your average scenario. Submissive Affliction is neither great nor terrible and the other remaining 3 cards are all quite bad, so it skates in smoothly.</p>

              <p>Brain Leech is the choice most players make, and why not?<p>The downside of the bottom is that it's very difficult for this class to use a bottom melee attack. Again, the normal way you'd do something like this is by letting an enemy get next to you before your turn, but that's really not a good idea most of the time on this class because of squishiness. So for us, the only realistic ways to consistently use the bottom action here is with Scurry top or by moving next to an enemy late and then attacking it twice early the next round. The problem with the latter is we already have Into the Night and Perverse Edge for these same situations and both of them are more often than not better (because they're more consistent in that we know we won't get hit when we're Invis or by a Stunned enemy). And with Scurry, we already have a number of bottoms that want Scurry top, so Scurry is pretty overworked. On top of that, if we use this bottom after the top of Scurry, we don't benefit from the Strengthen for our main Attack that round.</p></p>

              <p>The good thing on this card is the bottom action - more movement and Jump, plus some free Push.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Another big <i>Jump</i> is always welcome plus the free Push on bottom is really nice for getting trap or hazardous terrain value, but at the same time is worse than a Push on a top Attack because we can't make a melee Attack on an enemy that we Push away with our bottom Move action. So this bottom actually gets better the more ranged Attacks we have, which is something we'll grow more and more into at higher levels. I think, for this bottom move alone, this card is much better than a lot of people appreciate, especially at higher levels.</p>

Yeah, that's pretty much never what we're looking for.<p>With a bottom loss, two generic actions will be what we'll have to use this card as most of the time while we wait to use the top or bottom, and that's just so bad. Attack 2's on top were fine at level 1, but not at level 4, especially with the worst initiative in Gloomhaven.</p></p>

There's just no way that's the case here.</p><p>Ultimately, if you've played this class before and done some enhancement, or if you're just really rich, you can set up a world in which you have Ice on a couple bottom Moves and you use this top Augment.

              <p>The top of Mass Hysteria is great. Disarming is pretty much a hard CC for most enemies, and as you level your modifier deck should be getting pretty good so it's realistic to expect a significant amount of total damage from this attack, except when against Shielded enemies.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Adding a second Augment is just pretty mediocre. First of all, 50% of your best attacks from cards in the next 3 levels will be ranged, not melee, so Augments do get a bit worse at higher levels. Secondly, and more importantly, having 3 active cards is an enormous tax on longevity.</p>

              <p>Mass Hysteria is quite a decent card.<p>The top Ice production is still always welcome, especially as we will get one more Ice consumer in the next two levels. Oh, and 12 initiative, so there's that. The biggest problem with this action is that it scales very poorly as monsters level and distributed damage is a lot worse than focused damage as you're less likely to kill enemies and limit incoming attackers.</p><p>With the extra augments if you want to not really get punished, you need to bring them back each rest, which means you have to keep setting them up and taking them down, which means you're losing immediate power at the first half of each rest. Honestly, there are occasions where it's worth it, but for the most part, this is a strategy that does more harm than good. The exception would be on very short scenarios like one-room boss rushes, where you can just quickly get up to 2 Augments and not come back down because tempo is much more important than longevity.</p></p>

              <p>Corrupting Embrace sees your powerful top and raises you another powerful top. Here, we have no elemental requirements (the Ice was free, the Dark less so) and we get effectively attack 7, with Poison and Muddle thrown in for good measure.</p>

              <p>The downside is that this top attack is obviously much, much worse against Shielded enemies (or those with Retaliate).<p>AND THERE'S A BOTTOM?!

I think it's slightly better to take Dark Frenzy first because Corrupting Embrace is as its best once we're level 8 and Dark Frenzy bottom is probably the best action of the 4 (which is saying something) but it honestly doesn't make a huge difference either way. We should have used our summon enough for the perk point at this stage so we drop the card as we have 2 other Move 4+ cards. If you still don't have the perk you can drop Hostile Takeover until you do.</div>

If we have Dark, which we have a non-loss source of Dark now and another in a level, this top gets pretty crazy. Sadly, this does lock us into using Corrupting Embrace primarily for the bottom, which is a shame with such a good top, but we'll remedy that soon enough.</p><p>And then the bottom gives us another Move 5 (you can pretty much ignore the Shield there, although with so much Ice, it will occasionally matter a little bit), which is always welcome and really helps to free up a spot in our hand (it will both replace our ranged attacks and eventually also be able to stand-in as a second big Move when we need it).</p></p>

              <p>Phantasmal Killer on the other hand is pretty reasonable.<p>To be clear, I'm talking about the bottom here. The bottom does a lot of little things: gives you <i>Dark</i> for Shared Nightmare, gives you repeatable <i>Invisibility</i>, and grabs some <i>Loot</i> (all while moving). Nothing extraordinary except for the Invisibility, but it all adds up.</p><p>The top, on the other hand, is just bad for business. The potential to do non-loss executes with minimal cost is a very dangerous ability to have in Gloomhaven. You only have two other sources of non-loss Dark, one of which requires playing a top Loot action in combat. The issue is that this ability to execute is actually so strong in most scenarios that it's worth playing top Loot actions in combat just to execute the next turn. And when you consider that you can also enhance Dark on Moves, it really starts to get out of control. In general, I mostly avoid using executes like this because it makes the game less fun for you and the rest of your group (because damage ceases to matter on most enemies). But if you've never done something like this before, give it a try if you'd like. Bring Into the Night back in, setup this Augment, and execute twice per rest cycle. Then, once you're done with all of that, switch back to playing this card for the bottom, which will always feel nice.</p></p>
