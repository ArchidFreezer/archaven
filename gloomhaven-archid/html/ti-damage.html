    <h2 class="w3-light-grey">Overview</h2>
      <div class="w3-container">The Tinkerer is the support class of the starting 6. The Cragheart can also be somewhat of a support but the Tinkerer is the one true support option you start with. She has great healing and a medium-sized health pool. What she lacks, mostly, is damage. She has a number of attacks, some of which are quite decent, although many times they're good because of status effects rather than the damage they deal (further solidifying her role as a support). Her few really good damage attacks are all losses and unlike the Spellweaver, she can't reuse them. Unlike any other of the starting classes, however, she has a hand size of 12, which is enormous and both gives her a ton of longevity as well as the flexibility to use more loss cards than most other classes. She typically plays from ranged, as she has little benefit from getting into melee range, but a reasonable health pool and a huge hand size means she can risk getting up close and taking a few hits if absolutely necessary.</div>
      <div class="w3-container"><p>There are really two paths to take with the Tinkerer when you level her up: focusing on healing or focusing on damage-dealing. This guide will be for the damage build that is better for 3p group as the group may still need some support and the Tinkerer will bring just the right amount by focusing on the damage build. With the healing build, you may find yourself lacking damage when your group needs it more than healing.</p></div>

              <p>Big move loss. We don't really need big moves to get in the faces of enemies as a support.</p>

              <p>Energizing Tonic... The initiative is the only good thing about this card. The top is a reasonable heal with strengthen, but we aren't a class that has good melee attacks to use this on ourselves. The bottom loss is unnecessary. Don't play this card.</p>

              <p>The top is your standard level 1, attack 3, range 3, which will make it something you want to use often in order to help finish enemies off.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is also pretty useful. At the very worst it can add 1 attack to your ranged attacks when you don't need to move, and if you have other ranged allies or occasionally melee allies, it can add to their attacks as well. While it doesn't always do a lot, it will consistently add 1-2 attack, and sometimes more, making it a valuable bottom action.</p>

              <p>Enhancement Field is one of your hard-working staple attack cards.<p>The only shame is the bad initiative, which does mean it needs to be paired with a faster card (conveniently Toxic Bolt is perfect here) in order to get the buff up before your allies go.</p></p>

              <p>Flamethrower has the highest damage potential of your level 1 loss attacks. Wound is usually at least 1 damage meaning this is effectively at least attack 4 on each target, making it higher damage than Ink Bomb. It's worse, however, because it requires you to get into melee range to use it. That's worse not just because it can open you up to damage, but also because it limits your options for a bottom action, normally requiring a move.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>At the same time, the bottom of this card is much worse than the other 2 loss AoE attacks as it's much less frequently useful. There are times it can be used, but it's situational.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>The first level 1 AoE loss attack we'll look at for the Tinkerer, Flamethrower.<p>This card has both a situational top and bottom. Obviously the high upside of Flamethrower still makes this not terrible, but it's far below the other two much better overall AoE cards we have.</p></p>

              <p>If your group lacks a solid tank, there will be plenty of times when you'll want to bring out this summon to absorb some damage for a fight or two.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>I wouldn't overly fixate on the top though because the bottom is the best part of this card.<p>If bottom attacks are good for damage-dealers, bottom heals are just about as good for a healer. There are plenty of times when you won't need to move or will really need to heal and having a bottom heal action is great. 3 range makes it easy to not have to worry about not being able to move. You'll also be able to use this to remove poison and land a bigger top heal.</p></p>

              <p>Harmless Contraption is both a good and funny card. I love the summon flavour-wise, although mechanically it's pretty mediocre, the shield does provide a bit of longevity for it.<p>The only real downside of this card is the bad initiative, which is risky on a heal, but you'll just need to pair it with something faster, of which you have plenty.</p></p>

              <p>A top Move and Loot is situational, but something we can always use. That small enhancement dot next to the Move is very interesting as well as a top move 2 is very nice when moving between rooms given that we are usually towards the back of rooms.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Bottom attacks are always useful and this can be used to ground a flying enemy and then potentially pull them into a trap. The damage is fairly low.</p>

              <p>The top loss will normally be able to target 2 enemies, making it an attack 8, 1 behind Fire Orbs. Still, being 1 attack behind the best level 1 Spellweaver loss isn't such a terrible place to be.<p>There will occasionally be situations where you can hit 3 enemies with this, at which point it's insane attack for a level 1 card. Creating a dark doesn't really matter much but is just a small added bonus (and occasionally negative).</p></p>
              <hr>

              <p>It loses 1 attack on each target to immobilize. Obviously, power-wise, that's an upgrade, although it does add a situational effect rather than a generically-useful effect like attack. This loss attack therefore lends itself more towards supporting and less towards damage-dealing, as you'll prioritize using it when the immobilize matters in order to stop incoming damage. It's still an excellent loss attack.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom move is also powerful, if also again not as generically-useful as just a move 4. Still, there will be plenty of situations when the immobilize the move will stop an enemy from dealing damage for a round, which makes this great.</p>

              <p>The top is no better than a loss attack for the damage build.<p>The top loss has positives and negatives. The negatives are that you can't control when this triggers so you need to be careful with your healing plans afterwards to not accidentally waste charges on overhealing (you really need to get at least 8 healing out of this to make it worthwhile).</p><p>The positive is that you can combine this with AoE heals and since it's 'next four Heal actions', it will affect the entire action for only one charge. At level 1 this would be your move 2 heal 1 to all adjacent allies, turning it into a heal 3 on multiple targets. Not the easiest to pull off with a move 2, but it is doable and even just healing 2 people for 3 with that is great value. Boots that add movement can also help with this combo if you're going for the healing build.</p></p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is a move 3, which is, as always, neither great nor terrible. Still, it's something we can spam while we wait for the right moment to set up the top loss.</p>

              <p>The top is fairly terrible. The funny thing is that this might be good against enemies with high shield as a source of direct damage but most enemies with high shield actually fly, making this truly useless unless you use one of your grounding cards.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Fortunately, the bottom is a move 4, and we'll need some of those, so we may end up using this regardless.</p>

              <p>Proximity Mine - oh yay, another trap.<p>The top has a synergy with Hook Gun bottom as we can ground a flying enemy and pull them into a trap. The problem is that both these card have bad initiatives so we will likely be going after the enemy has attacked which is not good.</p></p>

              <p>The bottom loss, on the other hand, is more interesting.<p>It's reasonably-powerful, although not great. The biggest problem is that the card has a greater effect the sooner you use it, but the sooner you use it will also have a more painful effect on your longevity. Still, there can be a happy medium and some classes with small hand sizes (like the Scoundrel) can really benefit.</p><p>Conveniently, the Scoundrel has 9 cards, which means that whether you use this her first time or her second time through his deck, it will give her the same number of extra turns. So we can use this on round 4 or 8, which gives us more flexibility while still retaining the maximum effect from the loss.</p></p>

              <p>The top is a bit ahead of the curve for an average attack card at level 1, normally we'd expect 3 attack but this one will give us 4 attack if we can find 2 targets within range 3. Not terribly difficult to do, although it's much worse against shield, even small shield on enemies like guards or skeletons. Still, the upside is usually going to be worth it at early levels.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is much worse. A non-loss heal is heal 3 range 3 at level 1 and this is effectively 1 number higher (although 2 healing higher) for a loss. It is a bottom heal though, and sometimes a big heal now is what you need and the 4 range should let you get it to where it is needed most.

              <p>op actions that create traps aren't really very good at all. You have to do a fair amount of work to just do 2 damage and poison, which is a lot worse than just attacking for the same effect. Obviously there are some tricks you can do with traps to abuse enemy AI but situations where it's worth it are pretty rare and thus it's not really worth considering playing this half of this card.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, the bottom is not much better. At its base we trade an action and a card for a card for someone else and we have a short range restriction in order to even get to make this bad trade. 'Filler' (for situations where you're not actively fighting) actions like this on bottom are also rarely useful because we can usually just make filler moves to pick up loot. So we need someone who makes ice but doesn't use it, which isn't normally a thing, and even then we get an action that's barely worth it.</p>

          <p>These are our remaining card choices options which are significantly worse than the ones we already have. Flamethrower is fine but we already have 2 good loss attacks we want to use every scenario and thus adding another is doable but makes all 3 of them a bit worse. Potent Potables helps a lot with healing but is another loss. Proximity Mine has a bad top but a good bottom. Volatile Concoction and Energizing Tonic are just not good cards at all.</p>

Compare this to our level 1 stun card: stunning 3 enemies and doing no damage for a loss versus stunning 1 enemy and doing 1 damage (1 damage is significant as well because we can still flip modifiers, meaning it will end up being even better) for a non-loss. Yeah, this isn't an improvement on that card. Obviously there may be occasions where it's worth it to stun 3 enemies, but rarely.</p>

              <p>The top is just to disarm traps but 90% of the time it's better to use traps to your advantage rather than disarm them. I would say that maybe on 1/5 scenarios there will be one point on the map where the route you must go is blocked by traps and you need to deal with 1 in order to continue. Still, you'd rather push an enemy into one and realistically, you'll be better-off just triggering it with your feet on that rare occasion rather than having this card normally.</p>

              <p>The bottom is slightly more interesting even if it's not a good effect just because it can mess with enemy AI but it's still really weak.</p>

Quite simply, we're trying to limit the number of loss cards we have in order to make all of the ones we keep better. 3 losses is really the magic number (this shouldn't be surprising given that the lowest starting hand size is 9 and we have 12 cards) of losses we can use without really feeling it. So we'll like to stick right at 3-4 losses we really want to use and not more. If we keep too many cards because they have losses we want to use, we'll have all these options but not be able to use them all, making them all worse.<p>I should mention that there is commonly an exception to this: boss fights. Most boss fight scenarios are sprints rather than marathons and you can consider bringing more losses if you're doing a small-map boss fight scenario.</p></div>

              <p>The top is a crazy effect (not necessarily because it's that powerful but it just does a crazy sort of thing). It is, though, a very powerful and very situational effect. Just over 1/4 of regular enemies in the game will be able to be killed undamaged with this. Some scenarios there won't be any and some scenarios there will be a lot. On scenarios where this card is good, it can single-handedly win you the scenario. It is an amazing answer to all those little annoying enemies with high shield and low hp. And it can still work on other scenarios some of the time when your allies damage enemies.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Disarm on a non-loss move is sooooo good. Disarm is functionally stun against a large portion of the enemies in the game, and getting a free disable on a bottom where you still get to move is amazing. With this plus your stun attack you can remove 2 enemies from attacking for a round. I cannot possibly overemphasize just how good this effect is.

              <p>Everybody loves dropping down turrets, and here you get to drop one directly onto the payload, which we all know is the best place for it. 10 attack, split over 5 turns, targeted however you want is great. The only downside is, of course, that you really want to be sure you have a target for at least 4 of the next 5 turns, or this gets pretty bad. Fortunately, with range 5, and in the types of fights/scenarios where the Tinkerer is typically good, you shouldn't have a problem.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, until you find that spot, this gives you a very solid heal 3 range 4 on bottom. The Tinkerer is a wealth of good bottom actions, but it never hurts to add another.</p>

              <p>The top half is pretty good, giving you a lot of value for a non-loss with move 4 and heal 4 on top. The multiple small heals are also great at getting rid of Poison or Wound (Wound is very uncommon though, but Poison is quite common) on multiple allies/yourself. Heal 4 total on top by level 7, however, still just isn't that great, so for this card to be worthwhile you really want to use the move 4 in order to be using a significant bottom action.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Speaking of bottom actions, the bottom half of Curative Aerosol is just legitimately terrible for a loss action. You'd be best pretending this doesn't even exist, and adding an EXTREMELY situational bottom loss to a relatively situational top action just doesn't make for a great card at level 7.</p>

              <p>Fortunately, the bottom of this card is great. Attacks on bottom are always a nice option and this provides a very reasonable amount of damage for a level 7 non-loss attack.</p>

Reviving Shock was just there for the top attack, which is certainly still fine, but something has to go and multiple target 2 attacks by level 7 are just unimpressive. Enhancement Field is still a bit better because it has a real top and bottom and an attack 3 is 50% more likely to finish off a single enemy (a bit less with modifiers but still) which is typically more important than damaging two enemies a bit. Hook Gun would also be a candidate, but that top move is still nice and the bottom is still effective against flying enemies.</p></div>

              <p>Meanwhile, on the bottom, is another solid move 4 with a very nice upside. We won't always take advantage of the upside, but it's very free on this card and when we do, it will certainly be welcome.</p>
