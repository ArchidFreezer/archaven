    <p>The Scoundrel is a medium-hp class that is focused almost entirely around dealing damage with only small additional subthemes of dealing with traps, looting, and some basic conditions like Poison (which just translates into more damage).</p>
    <p>So what does the Scoundrel need to play with? Honestly, a melee companion. In my mind, this isn't optional. Can you play without one? Sure. Will you be as strong? No. Will it be as fun for you? Not really. You'll not only be doing less damage (especially at early levels), you'll also be gaining significantly less experience and have less meaningful choice in card selection both while levelling and when building your hand for each scenario. So for 2-player parties, I would only recommend playing with a Brute or Mindthief (of the starting classes). Both of these party compositions are strong and fun. In 3p and 4p, just continue the same trend, one melee ally is necessary, but you don't need to have exclusively melee allies. A second point I've had to combat in the past: can you have too much damage? No! That's just not possible in Gloomhaven for the vast majority of scenarios. Damage is what makes your party tick. So If you have a party of Brute, Mindthief, and Spellweaver, it's still perfectly fine to roll a Scoundrel to go with them. You don't have to have a 'balanced party' of support and damage. More damage can easily be just as good. So if you want to play a Scoundrel in a party that has a melee ally, do it, don't overthink it any further than that.</p>
    <p>The Scoundrel has the lowest possible effective hand size in the game and thus is ill-equipped to consistently play loss cards because she will simply exhaust too early. The Scoundrel's cards are balanced by giving her more powerful non-loss cards to make up for her inability to play losses. Additionally, not only can we rarely afford to play losses, but being a relatively-squishy melee character with very early initiatives, it's inevitable we will get hit, and getting hit will many times mean losing cards. I would say, on average, while playing on a challenging difficulty, you should expect to have to lose one card to negate damage every scenario. Occasionally it won't happen, but if you count on it not happening and then play a loss that you probably shouldn't, you may cost yourself a scenario you could have otherwise won. Obviously there are some exceptions to this rule as well: if you're playing with something like a Tinkerer, who can both keep you healthy and give you back cards, you have more flexibility to play losses. Additionally, while we don't want to play losses for average scenarios, we absolutely do still want to play losses for short scenarios/boss fights, where many of our losses shine.</p>
