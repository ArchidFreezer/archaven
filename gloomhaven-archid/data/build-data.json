          "This Red Guard build centres around the Shield Spikes card that retaliates damage based on the Shield value at the time of the hit. This means that the build is not overly interested in the AMD or damage abilities, focussing instead on consistently increasing our shield value. We use both enhancements and items to increase this value. Because some of the decenbt shileding items are not found until higher wealth levels the build can feel a little underwhelming at the start if these have not been unlocked yet.",
          "Applying the <i>Immobilize</i> status effect is also very useful to us as it means we can lock down ranged enemies so they do not attempt to move away and we can get our retaliate to proc."

        "benefits": [
          "Strong against the typically difficult high shield/retaliate enemies.",
          "Strong against swarming enemies as they tend to be low health, low damage and our shields can negate much if not all the damage, whilst dishing out direct damage back."

The Spellweaver, Tinkerer and Voidwarden also have cards that can help.",
          "Party members that can heal us, especially at lower levels when we have loiwer shield values.",

It lets us position to tank a hit and goes early enough to beat almost any monster. The only problem is that <i>Fire</i> will be the one element we never have enough of, but the payoff is worth it.",

This lets you do both at once, which is a huge improvement.

          "Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.",

          "top": "Saw has some really powerful losses, even at level 1 with things like Booster Shot and sometimes Vaccine, so the bar is quite high and this largely falls short. Why? A bunch of reasons:<ol><li> Healing losses are typically the worst losses in Gloomhaven. Healing just isn't something you normally want to do as a primary action in combat because it's basically just putting a band-aid on huge gash - you help with the symptoms, but you're not addressing the problem that lead to the symptoms, and thus things will just get worse again next turn. Typically, if you're in a bad spot, you're better off using a loss for a big attack or crowd control in order to survive combat and then heal up afterwards. For example, it's almost always better to use an Attack 4, Stun loss than a Heal 6 loss.</li><li>Even if you would desperately want healing badly enough to play a loss, this is delayed healing, so it doesn't even immediately address the problem. You have to play this and then wait another turn to just get the effect, which is insane!</li><li>Med Packs are a useful mechanic that we'll play with a fair amount on this class but the biggest thing med packs do is giving extra longevity (free turns), whether played for healing or default actions. A large med pack and a small med pack give the same amount of longevity, only one of them actually costs longevity to give.</li></ol>",
          "bottom": "The bottom non-loss is quite powerful (because immunity to negative conditions removes existing conditions) and is a bonus to movement. The problem is the initiative which means that the immunity comes after most enemy attacks will have happened so we would need to pair it with another lower initiative card to make the card really effective.",
          "overall": "Battlefield Medicine starts us off at a pretty low point. This card is simply not good, although it can be powerful on some scenarios. The biggest problem is that it's a loss combined with a highly situational effect. "

          "bottom": "Bottom Loot actions are generally quite bad (because you can't Move and Loot in the same turn, thus you're better off typically just moving and picking up coins by being on top of them at the end of your turn) but at least this one is attached to a top action that we want every rest cycle so it's pretty free to have it there and will mostly just help in scenarios that require Loot actions.",
          "overall": "Bloody Saw, on the other hand, is a very good card.<p>The initiative is pretty good, although we have some really good initiatives, still this card's initiative will matter because of the combo with Hold Back the Pain (seen later).</p>"

Fortunately, as we're a melee character who's likely to take a fair number of hits each scenario, many times the target will just be us. That being said, we're not actually going to have this Heal action for very long, as we're only keeping this card at low levels or if we intend on playing the bottom loss, and if we're playing the bottom loss, it's typically the earlier, the better.",
          "bottom": "The bottom loss is excellent if we have any sort of tank or tanky character in our party. With a Sunkeeper or Red Guard this action becomes overpowered as they are naturally tanky on their own and this is a significant boost to already powerful classes. Thus, it's more if you have a tanky melee ally, use this bottom loss as early as you conveniently can in most scenarios on that ally and watch them (and your whole party) enjoy the significant increase in damage mitigation.",

The top will still end up being useful outside of combat though, so neither half is bad.",
          "bottom": "It's often going to be more convenient to simply use this bottom action, which provides you with a 19-initiative Move 3, to remove the condition and instead still get to play a meaningful top action.",
          "overall": "Ultimately though, while being a nice card, our deck has a ton of nice cards, which means that beyond early levels, this isn't a card that's going to go into our deck by default. Instead, you should consider bringing it to each scenario on an individual basis depending on the negative conditions present.<p>It's decent against Poison-rich scenarios and it's excellent against Shaman (who can Disarm and Immobilize), excellent against level 4+ Wind Demons, Spitting Drakes (where you can get Stunned but also they do Muddle so it still does something), etc. So consider the scenario and the enemies and if it seems that there are enough conditions to merit this card, bring it.

          "overall": "The initiative is also a lot worse here, as the 60-70 range is typically the worst initiative in the game (neither able to reliably go before or after enemies). That being said, we just don't have that many Attack actions, so even one that's worse than another we already have isn't terrible for us (and Bloody Saw is also a really good Attack, so this being a bit worse still makes this fine, if not exciting)."

          "bottom": "So yeah, this bottom action... As I said in the introduction, this class often gets a bad rap as it's misunderstood as being a 'support class.' Does this bottom action look 'supporty' to you?! No, it looks insane! Any melee Attack you want can be a huge AoE! That scales incredibly well with levels and items. And it starts off as just letting you do an Attack 3 Wound on all adjacent enemies with 25 initiative.<p>It gets truly absurd at level 8. So how should you use this combo? You typically want to try to run in late so that the enemies go before you and you can get into a good spot safely (Hamstring [2] bottom Move is the natural combo), then go early in the next round with this combo. Obviously, you'll need some backup from your allies to help CC or kill some of the targets or you risk taking a lot of damage, but given the power level of what you're doing, they should be happy to help out.</p>",

Take this card, keep it close, spam the top every chance you get, and laugh maniacally at the 25% of people who rated this class as 'underpowered.'",

          "bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is extremely powerful, giving us hard CC on a bottom action that also adds Poison for free (this would be a fine bottom Attack at just Attack 1, Stun - compare to the Brute's Attack 2 on bottom or the Scoundrel's Attack 3 on bottom at level 1). You can easily move next to an enemy late in the previous round, then go early with this excellent initiative, Stun them, Poison then, and then benefit from the Poison with your top Attack as well (bonus points if your top Attack is Bloody Saw, where the Wound + the Stun here will do 2 extra damage)! Again, with actions like this we're combining good damage and CC, which makes us both a formidable damage-dealer who also prevents damage (the best kind of support).",

In order for this to work, everyone needs to move in a specific way and they also all need to be at ideal points in their rest cycles where this gives back a meaningful amount of cards. Beyond that, this really needs to be done out of combat because of your lack of a combat-oriented top action combined with the movement restrictions for your allies, but recovering discarded cards out of combat is a lot less impressive (because you don't get to replay your best actions). Still, the effect can be impressive, so there's certainly room for the right party to try to build around this action, but on average I'd recommend just forgetting about it and focusing on the powerful and consistent actions you can perform regularly.",
          "bottom": "While the bottom isn't bad, it's also not great as our nature of being a melee-attacker/CC'er relies on us needing movement more than our allies, thus while technically more powerful than a Move 4, it's typically going to be worse.",

And because Poison gets better the more health the target has (as it will represent more damage), this action scales amazingly with levels and difficulty. Being ranged lets us apply this to high-hp targets (which are typically slow but hit hard) without putting ourselves in danger.",

The most common use for the bottom will be on scenarios with a lot of Poison that are also short and where you have a tanky ally (allowing you to put this and Booster Shot on the same ally). Again, that represents a large longevity cost, so the scenario does need to be short.",
          "overall": "Vaccine is, I believe, the most underrated level 1 card in the game.<p>More than anything, more than all the talk about how effective this top action is, the biggest value is in flexibility. Aside from this top action, we are entirely melee. Having a single ranged Attack adds sooooooo much flexibility into how we can still be effective in a huge variety of combat situations. Just ask any Brute how good Spare Dagger is for them - it's not because the action is that powerful, it's just because a single ranged Attack on an otherwise melee class will get an enormous amount of use. And this action is much, much more powerful than the already-excellent Spare Dagger.</p>"

Also, if our allies are long resting or catching up with us (as we have some great movement compared to many classes) when between combat, we can play this bottom with First Aid top to give out two med packs in a turn, which is sweet.",

          "Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.",

          "top": "Saw has some really powerful losses, even at level 1 with things like Booster Shot and sometimes Vaccine, so the bar is quite high and this largely falls short. Why? A bunch of reasons:<ol><li> Healing losses are typically the worst losses in Gloomhaven. Healing just isn't something you normally want to do as a primary action in combat because it's basically just putting a band-aid on huge gash - you help with the symptoms, but you're not addressing the problem that lead to the symptoms, and thus things will just get worse again next turn. Typically, if you're in a bad spot, you're better off using a loss for a big attack or crowd control in order to survive combat and then heal up afterwards. For example, it's almost always better to use an Attack 4, Stun loss than a Heal 6 loss.</li><li>Even if you would desperately want healing badly enough to play a loss, this is delayed healing, so it doesn't even immediately address the problem. You have to play this and then wait another turn to just get the effect, which is insane!</li><li>Med Packs are a useful mechanic that we'll play with a fair amount on this class but the biggest thing med packs do is giving extra longevity (free turns), whether played for healing or default actions. A large med pack and a small med pack give the same amount of longevity, only one of them actually costs longevity to give.</li></ol>",
          "bottom": "The bottom non-loss is quite powerful (because immunity to negative conditions removes existing conditions) and is a bonus to movement.

          "overall": "Battlefield Medicine starts us off at a pretty low point. This card is simply not good, although it can be powerful on some scenarios. The biggest problem is that it's a loss combined with a highly situational effect. "

          "overall": "Bloody Saw, on the other hand, is a very good card.<p>The initiative is pretty good, although we have some really good initiatives, still this card's initiative will matter because of the combo with Hold Back the Pain (seen later).</p>"

Fortunately, as we're a melee character who's likely to take a fair number of hits each scenario, many times the target will just be us. That being said, we're not actually going to have this Heal action for very long, as we're only keeping this card at low levels or if we intend on playing the bottom loss, and if we're playing the bottom loss, it's typically the earlier, the better.",
          "bottom": "The bottom loss is excellent if we have any sort of tank or tanky character in our party. With a Sunkeeper or Red Guard this action becomes overpowered as they are naturally tanky on their own and this is a significant boost to already powerful classes.

Instead, you should consider bringing it to each scenario on an individual basis depending on the negative conditions present.<p>It's decent against Poison-rich scenarios and it's excellent against Shaman (who can Disarm and Immobilize), excellent against level 4+ Wind Demons, Spitting Drakes (where you can get Stunned but also they do Muddle so it still does something), etc. So consider the scenario and the enemies and if it seems that there are enough conditions to merit this card, bring it.

And it starts off as just letting you do an Attack 3 Wound on all adjacent enemies with 25 initiative.<p>It gets truly absurd at level 8. So how should you use this combo? You typically want to try to run in late so that the enemies go before you and you can get into a good spot safely (Hamstring [2] bottom Move is the natural combo), then go early in the next round with this combo. Obviously, you'll need some backup from your allies to help CC or kill some of the targets or you risk taking a lot of damage, but given the power level of what you're doing, they should be happy to help out.</p>",

You can easily move next to an enemy late in the previous round, then go early with this excellent initiative, Stun them, Poison then, and then benefit from the Poison with your top Attack as well (bonus points if your top Attack is Bloody Saw, where the Wound + the Stun here will do 2 extra damage)!

In order for this to work, everyone needs to move in a specific way and they also all need to be at ideal points in their rest cycles where this gives back a meaningful amount of cards. Beyond that, this really needs to be done out of combat because of your lack of a combat-oriented top action combined with the movement restrictions for your allies, but recovering discarded cards out of combat is a lot less impressive (because you don't get to replay your best actions). Still, the effect can be impressive, so there's certainly room for the right party to try to build around this action, but on average I'd recommend just forgetting about it and focusing on the powerful and consistent actions you can perform regularly.",

It might seem like we really should cut Bloody Saw, but we just need the extra top Attack (even more-so in this build as we don't have Amputate) and the good initiative to go with Hold Back the Pain. Cutting a fine level 2 card over our level 1 cards should also help to demonstrate just how good some of our level 1 cards are."

The problem is when is it actually good? In order to use this, you need to be somewhere you're going to get attacked multiple times. But in most of those situations, attacking first and then moving will usually save you more health by virtue of being able to avoid attacks, and movement is always helpful. This might be better against ranged enemies, but against ranged enemies you usually need to constantly be moving in order to close the distance and kill them one by one, and standing still to absorb their attacks only works if you have a ranged Attack to damage them with. You do have one ranged Attack but it's usually going to be used when you enter new rooms and can't make it to enemies rather than when you're already there, which is what this requires.",

Early (typically approximately 25 or lower) initiative is very important in Gloomhaven in order to perform your actions before monsters act and late (typically higher than 75) initiative is also quite important in order to set up your turns such that monsters go before you and move toward you without reaching you to perform Attacks. Being right in the middle of the two while still on the late end is really the worst spot possible. 60-75 initiative is generally the worst initiative bracket in the game.</p>"

In that case, you'd rather be moving away or using something defensive most of the time, not adding one to your Attack. Even Attack 2 on the bottom of Spare Dagger is much better in the aforementioned situation because you have a better chance of eliminating one enemy and only being attacked by one, whereas here, unless the one extra Attack is enough to finish someone off, you're in trouble.<p>Compounding things, here you have to use this first to get the benefit. For example, if you get an unlucky modifier on your attack with the top attack when using Spare Dagger on the bottom to kill an enemy, you can now, at worst, use Spare Dagger's bottom as a Move 2 (or 4 with boots) to get away and not get pounded. Because you have to use this bottom first, you're doubling down on the risk of getting a bad modifier, which is a very Brute problem if you've ever seen his modifier deck in action.</p>",

The problem with healing yourself (or healing in general) while fighting is that you do it instead of something else, which usually means you're not eliminating enemies as quickly as you should be or not avoiding damage, which can negate or diminish the effect of the Heal. By being able to set this up BEFORE you get into a big fight, you get all the upside of healing without the downside.

Once we get access to Immovable Phalanx top at level 6, we'll have a perfect combo for this card where we get to both go early enough most of the time and stack multiple instances of Shield, which makes them both better.

The truth is that we took Skirmishing Manoeuvre for the bottom more than the top and that was at level 5, this action at level 8 is really just underwhelming. The biggest reason people will take this card is to play it with Immovable Phalanx loss, but then you're still getting rid of your best non-loss action, you're accepting poor initiative, and it's still not very good against a big portion of Gloomhaven monsters that have Shield or Retaliate.",

Provoking Roar was ultimately just our weakest card and the most logical to replace. That being said, if you're facing the 'Guard' monster type, I would typically recommend bringing Provoking Roar over Eye for an Eye as Guards have their two fastest initiatives precisely at 15. Accordingly, 10 is a significant difference compared to 18 against Guards."

This bottom will get more mileage for you at lower levels (where it's also great for free XP) before you have access to more ways to create Light, and you can normally bench it once you can create Light consistently, just bringing it in when you see Poison or Wound as being an4 issue based on the enemies in a scenario.",

The reason it's so helpful to you is the guaranteed source of Light. Now it's not the best source of Light for a damage-dealer because you don't want to have to take a turn off during combat to heal most of the time, but many times it will be worth it. Once you have more options for sources of Light, you can bench this card if healing isn't a priority for your build of the Sunkeeper (based on your party's needs).",

At level 1 this will be slightly more conditional than the Scoundrel's level 1 Attack 5's, but also better because of Advantage. Over time, as light generation becomes easier, it will be significantly better than the respective attacks from the Scoundrel, making you a very solid melee damage-dealer.",

It's not too hard to make sure you're constantly in front of your party as, lacking ranged Attacks, you naturally want to move into melee range anyway. The amount of damage this action will mitigate in an average scenario is pretty shocking. The drawback here is very real - constantly limiting your movement is a huge penalty and you'll need to work hard to overcome it, but it's definitely worth it. It's also worth mentioning that you can dismiss (move this card from active to the lost pile) this card when you desperately need to move further at the end of a scenario. There may also even be a few scenarios with very harsh movement requirements where you won't want to play this persistent loss, although those scenarios will be few and far between.<p>Almost no matter the situation, you should pretty much always try your best to play this bottom action on turn 1 of each scenario.</p>",

This enhancement may very well be the most cost-effective enhancement in all of Gloomhaven and should be done as soon as possible. I'd typically buy just a couple items to start (Boots of Striding, Iron Helmet, and a small potion or two) and then immediately start saving to get this enhancement. Shield increases do not scale linearly - Shield 2 is more than twice as strong as Shield 1. Why? Because as you reach higher Shield values, it becomes easier and easier to simply accept incoming Attacks.

Normally, when you need healing, you need it NOW, not a turn from now. This is because most of the time you want to be killing enemies and not healing, you usually only need healing when something went wrong or when moving between rooms/cleaning up with nothing else to do. If you're moving between rooms/cleaning up, it's not very likely that a) you have the Light to spend, because you probably spent it killing off enemies and b) you want to use a loss card anyway. If something went wrong, it's impossible to say whether you'll have a Light ready or not. Finally, even if you have Light ready and want healing, it's not guaranteed that two different targets will both really need the healing that badly. Thus, while this top can be a powerful heal, it rarely will be.",

Still, the bottom Attack is fine, and the main thing making this card playable.",

This is a great example of a good situational loss card. The card is only let down by its terrible initiative for a crowd control card - disables like Disarm or Stun are typically better if you can be sure to go before your target, whereas this will require another card to go early (something you mostly lack). Fortunately, Stun is much better than Disarm when used for the following round as you can disregard the enemy entirely, rather than still having to worry about certain monster deck flips, so it's still almost never bad.</p>"

I believe that you need three sources of Light per rest cycle to make this loss easily worth it, so that would be Mobilizing Axiom, level 8 card, and one enhancement of Light on a Move action (Tactical Order).

It's still hard to pull off though because you can't move and use it in the same turn, meaning the summons need to already be in range of you and adjacent to their targets, which if you have much experience with summons or cats, is basically like trying to tell a cat what to do.</p>"

She also has one of the slowest average rates of experience gain in the game, which is a serious issue for a tanking class as it's important for tanks to remain at or above the average level of their party.",

You also have an 11 card hand size, meaning you can certainly afford a couple losses here and there when necessary. This bottom will get more mileage for you at lower levels (where it's also great for free XP) before you have access to more ways to create Light, and you can normally bench it once you can create Light consistently, just bringing it in when you see Poison or Wound as being an4 issue based on the enemies in a scenario.",

The reason it's so helpful to you is the guaranteed source of Light. Now it's not the best source of Light for a damage-dealer because you don't want to have to take a turn off during combat to heal most of the time, but many times it will be worth it. Once you have more options for sources of Light, you can bench this card if healing isn't a priority for your build of the Sunkeeper (based on your party's needs).",

At level 1 this will be slightly more conditional than the Scoundrel's level 1 Attack 5's, but also better because of Advantage. Over time, as light generation becomes easier, it will be significantly better than the respective attacks from the Scoundrel, making you a very solid melee damage-dealer.",

It's not too hard to make sure you're constantly in front of your party as, lacking ranged Attacks, you naturally want to move into melee range anyway. The amount of damage this action will mitigate in an average scenario is pretty shocking. The drawback here is very real - constantly limiting your movement is a huge penalty and you'll need to work hard to overcome it, but it's definitely worth it. It's also worth mentioning that you can dismiss (move this card from active to the lost pile) this card when you desperately need to move further at the end of a scenario. There may also even be a few scenarios with very harsh movement requirements where you won't want to play this persistent loss, although those scenarios will be few and far between.<p>Almost no matter the situation, you should pretty much always try your best to play this bottom action on turn 1 of each scenario.</p>",
          "overall": "Defensive Stance is THE defining card for the Sunkeeper.<p>We haven't talked about the biggest deal on the bottom action: the little enhancement dot next to the 'Shield 1.' This enhancement may very well be the most cost-effective enhancement in all of Gloomhaven and should be done as soon as possible. I'd typically buy just a couple items to start (Boots of Striding, Iron Helmet, and a small potion or two) and then immediately start saving to get this enhancement. Shield increases do not scale linearly - Shield 2 is more than twice as strong as Shield 1. Why? Because as you reach higher Shield values, it becomes easier and easier to simply accept incoming Attacks. Accordingly, this enhancement takes an already-powerful action and completely supercharges it.</p>"

If you can double it with a Light, it certainly can become worth it, although there's a problem with healing that has elemental requirements. Normally, when you need healing, you need it NOW, not a turn from now. This is because most of the time you want to be killing enemies and not healing, you usually only need healing when something went wrong or when moving between rooms/cleaning up with nothing else to do. If you're moving between rooms/cleaning up, it's not very likely that a) you have the Light to spend, because you probably spent it killing off enemies and b) you want to use a loss card anyway. If something went wrong, it's impossible to say whether you'll have a Light ready or not. Finally, even if you have Light ready and want healing, it's not guaranteed that two different targets will both really need the healing that badly. Thus, while this top can be a powerful heal, it rarely will be.",

Attacks on bottom are always welcome, although this class does have plenty going on for it with bottoms that aren't just movement (and you really need to move with your bottom action most of the time), so it's less necessary than for some other classes. Still, the bottom Attack is fine, and the main thing making this card playable.",

          "overall": "Holy Strike is a tale of two halves.<p>While it's definitely not one of the better loss cards in your deck, the fact that the top half is so incredibly spammable means you lose nothing by keeping the option around. This is a great example of a good situational loss card. The card is only let down by its terrible initiative for a crowd control card - disables like Disarm or Stun are typically better if you can be sure to go before your target, whereas this will require another card to go early (something you mostly lack). Fortunately, Stun is much better than Disarm when used for the following round as you can disregard the enemy entirely, rather than still having to worry about certain monster deck flips, so it's still almost never bad.</p>"

Well, with a different initiative, it wouldn't be particularly impressive. But Feedback Loop is a hidden all-star just because of the 79 initiative. The Mindthief actually gets a ton of great early initiative but truly lacks late initiative. Late initiative is extremely important on this class for two reasons: you're a squishy often-melee class, so you want to be able to run into the enemies after they've acted, not before. In addition to that, you have non-loss Invis at levels 1 and 9, which you typically want to follow with a late initiative. Thus, Feedback Loop, a card that doesn't seem nearly as splashy as others like Perverse Edge or Frigid Apparition, actually keeps them company until we find a replacement at level 3.</p>"

Still, at level 1, the stats are pretty decent and sometimes it will be worth bringing it out in the middle of the fray. Unusually, this summons is not a persistent loss so has much more value than normal and so can be used as a meat shield in combat as well as the standard use of late in the round to get a go the next round early.",

The biggest strike against this card is that we already have Feedback Loop, which adds Jump at the cost of having 3 worse initiative, which is a very good trade.</p>"

Fortunately, Into the Night already goes pretty early, so you've got that covered, but that does mean you'll really want to make sure you have another card with late initiative to go the following round (otherwise you can just long rest, but you - or more accurately your allies - don't always want that to be your turn in the middle of combat).</p>"

So for us, the only realistic ways to consistently use the bottom action here is with Scurry top or by moving next to an enemy late and then attacking it twice early the next round. The problem with the latter is we already have Into the Night and Perverse Edge for these same situations and both of them are more often than not better (because they're more consistent in that we know we won't get hit when we're Invis or by a Stunned enemy). And with Scurry, we already have a number of bottoms that want Scurry top, so Scurry is pretty overworked.

The issue is that this ability to execute is actually so strong in most scenarios that it's worth playing top Loot actions in combat just to execute the next turn. And when you consider that you can also enhance Dark on Moves, it really starts to get out of control. In general, I mostly avoid using executes like this because it makes the game less fun for you and the rest of your group (because damage ceases to matter on most enemies).

We drop Empathetic Assault as something has to go here and we are replacing one good bottom with another, but with a much better top."

Well, with a different initiative, it wouldn't be particularly impressive. But Feedback Loop is a hidden all-star just because of the 79 initiative. The Mindthief actually gets a ton of great early initiative but truly lacks late initiative. Late initiative is extremely important on this class for two reasons: you're a squishy often-melee class, so you want to be able to run into the enemies after they've acted, not before. In addition to that, you have non-loss Invis at levels 1 and 9, which you typically want to follow with a late initiative. Thus, Feedback Loop, a card that doesn't seem nearly as splashy as others like Perverse Edge or Frigid Apparition, actually keeps them company until we find a replacement at level 3.</p>"

Still, at level 1, the stats are pretty decent and sometimes it will be worth bringing it out in the middle of the fray.

Fortunately, Into the Night already goes pretty early, so you've got that covered, but that does mean you'll really want to make sure you have another card with late initiative to go the following round (otherwise you can just long rest, but you - or more accurately your allies - don't always want that to be your turn in the middle of combat).</p>"

Stunning enemies is the second best thing an action can do in Gloomhaven, aside from just killing them, and you're absolutely going to want to do your best to use this to that effect every rest cycle.</p>",
          "overall": "In my opinion, this non-loss bottom action makes this into the best starter level 1 card outside of The Mind's Weakness and Reviving Ether. Getting to Stun an enemy with a bottom action while still having your top action to Attack is incredible.<p>We can even increase the range on the bottom or add a Wound to the top attack for a very powerful combo.</p>"

So for us, the only realistic ways to consistently use the bottom action here is with Scurry top or by moving next to an enemy late and then attacking it twice early the next round. The problem with the latter is we already have Into the Night and Perverse Edge for these same situations and both of them are more often than not better (because they're more consistent in that we know we won't get hit when we're Invis or by a Stunned enemy). And with Scurry, we already have a number of bottoms that want Scurry top, so Scurry is pretty overworked.

The issue is that this ability to execute is actually so strong in most scenarios that it's worth playing top Loot actions in combat just to execute the next turn. And when you consider that you can also enhance Dark on Moves, it really starts to get out of control. In general, I mostly avoid using executes like this because it makes the game less fun for you and the rest of your group (because damage ceases to matter on most enemies).

I think it's slightly better to take Dark Frenzy first because Corrupting Embrace is as its best once we're level 8 and Dark Frenzy bottom is probably the best action of the 4 (which is saying something) but it honestly doesn't make a huge difference either way. We should have used our summon enough for the perk point at this stage so we drop the card as we have 2 other Move 4+ cards. If you still don't have the perk you can drop Hostile Takeover until you do."

If you end up going for the Expose build, Bless on that dot is one of the more exciting enhancements you can do on an otherwise pretty boring-to-enhance class. And Strengthen on that dot is one of the biggest selling points of not needing to go for the Expose build. So either way, we're going to like this card to begin with, and it's going to become stellar with enhancement (which, conveniently, it being a top Loot action will lead to happening sooner rather than later).</p>",

So you have multiple requirements and a delayed effect. And meanwhile, the actions are typically not balanced around all of that. For example, here, an Attack 4, Stun loss at level 1 is pretty mediocre to begin with. This is 4 direct damage instead of 4 Attack, which is typically better, although because it's a trap, it can't affect most of the enemies where direct damage is best (because they fly). So this top action asks you to jump through a bunch of hoops just to get an effect that wouldn't even be that compelling if it was offered immediately and with no hoops. That makes these actions (trap actions) generally quite awful. The best use for traps is typically to mess with monster AI, so non-loss traps do have some application, but loss traps are just a waste of an action (again, something that will be a recurring trend for this class).",
          "bottom": "The bottom is an interesting Doom, and has some value just by virtue of being a Doom, but we have a TON of Dooms at level 1 and while this is a unique effect, it's just not that powerful most of the time, and we'd rather 2 more damage per turn over this pretty much every day of the week.",

And this effect can be very good against a number of different enemies types.

And then this will also be good against high-number swarming enemies like Sneks and Vermling.",
          "overall": "Detonation is still an interesting card though because of the Doom on bottom. We have two Doom actions which are our 'good ones' that we'll want to use every rest cycle and have up as much as possible (Race to the Grave and Rain of Arrows) but beyond that, we normally want to have access to 3-4 total Dooms in order to guarantee we can always Attack enemies with Dooms up. Thus, the very nature of being a Doom to begin with does make an action interesting. It didn't for the above Crippling Noose because we knew we had some others like this coming."

They tend to just suicide a lot, running into AoEs, avoidable enemy Attacks, Shield/Retaliate, etc. There's really nothing unique or powerful about this summon, so it's a hard pass.",
          "bottom": "But again, this card is interesting for the Doom. This Doom doesn't directly affect combat, but it does provide a significant amount of free movement (please note that as of Forgotten Circles, this movement is considered a Teleport and is not affected by Immobilize, contrary to the base game FAQ). I talked in the intro about how we naturally play in combat - making a big Move and then some turns not moving. We have to Move to get into range to Attack, but we have to Doom in order to make our Attacks good, which gives this natural cadence of alternating Move turns and non-Move turns. Felling Swoop bottom gives us some valuable action efficiency by squishing those two turns into one, with a Doom that will put us in range of our next enemy once we kill the first enemy, allowing us to go straight from Doom turn to Doom turn without a Move turn in between, giving us a tempo boost. Thus, this is a very solid Doom, even if it doesn't look like much at first glance. Also note that Dooms don't have Range or line-of-sight restrictions, which means you can cheese some split-up scenarios with this type of action, Dooming an enemy near your allies and letting them kill it for you.",

Still, sometimes if a melee enemy manages to get on top of us, we can go early with a top Attack and use this bottom to effectively CC that enemy, which isn't the worst ever.",

That being said, this Attack will more often be made without a Doom than with one, as this is typically going to be our opener when entering a new room, and we will play this after moving, meaning no Doom right away. Still, it fills that roll just fine and obviously we can't complain about 'just' getting Attack 4. It does get worse if you have allies who spread small amounts of damage, but most of the time you can coordinate with them. ",
          "bottom": "The bottom is less exciting as a Move 3, Jump isn't anything special and we do generally prefer bigger Moves, but it is our only level 1 Jump and sometimes it will just be necessary for traversing the map, so we're happy to have it there when we need to, alongside a top Attack we'll use basically every rest cycle.",

At the same time, we have multiple non-loss Attacks for 4 at level 1, so you have to be sure that the extra 4 Attack will make a significant difference, or again it's just better to rest early and get your non-losses back.",
          "bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom Doom is also okay, although its power level is much more party-dependent. If you have a 4p party with attacking allies or you have allies with summons, then you'll typically find this Doom to be quite good. If you're in a 2p party or a 3p party with an ally that basically never attacks, then it will be much worse than Detonation and Felling Swoop. It should typically be pretty obvious just how good this Doom is based on your party and you should use it or not use it accordingly.",
          "overall": "Multi-Pronged Assault is a perfectly serviceable card.<p>Finally, this card gives us our first good early initiative, which is also welcome, even if we'll have a couple others.</p>"

          "bottom": "But the real draw of this card is the amazing bottom. Two direct damage per turn is pretty insane! This allows us to very, very easily kill some of the most annoying enemies in the game like Flame Demons and Vermling Shaman (and because the Doom has no range or line-of-sight limitations, you can always get it on the highest-priority target). Beyond enemies it's good against, it's also still just 2 extra damage per turn on something that counts as a Doom, so unless we're making multiple Attacks per turn, it's just as good as Rain of Arrows, our other best Doom, with the upside of also sometimes destroying high-shield enemies.",
          "overall": "Mmm... Race to the Grave, one of our two primary Dooms.<p>Another excellent point in this card's favour is the fact that the Doom triggers without attacking, which makes it a perfect Doom to play on the turn you setup Expose and similar cards where you don't get to Attack for the turn (or on the turn your ally opens a door, this way even if you can't get in to Attack, you're already doing damage and you have your Doom ready on a target for your Attack next turn). That way, even if it's not great damage for the turn, you're still doing something.</p>Finally, this card has excellent initiative, which pairs well with an effect that you want to apply before an enemy acts for the turn. Overall, just a great card, even if the top is poor. Sometimes one excellent half is all it takes.</p>"

This is somewhere in between - it doesn't really have an immediate tempo effect, but it also doesn't provide enough value over the course of a scenario to compare with good persistent losses like Expose.

The problem is that we already have a couple cards that are much, much easier to use against those enemies (Race to the Grave and Detonation), which work with what we normally want to do anyway, don't require us putting ourselves in an awkward position where a lot can go wrong, and aren't losses.",

It combines very well with certain items and it can have a significant impact on making some rooms much, much easier. So with all of that said, why aren't we taking this card? A few reasons:<ol><li>losses scale poorly in Gloomhaven, both with levels and with difficulty. When you're against level 3 enemies, this loss looks exceptional. When you're against level 5 enemies, this loss looks fine. When you're against level 7 enemies, this loss looks mediocre.</iL<li>This loss doesn't fix any of our problems. This is actually the biggest reason we're not taking Darkened Skies. At level 3, we have 3-4 good non-loss Attacks (3 if we took Offensive at level 2). For a 12-card class, that's so bad. Solid Bow is fine as well, but that's still not close to enough non-loss Attacks relative to our hand size (and Solid Bow often needs to be a Move). We NEED, desperately, non-loss Attacks, especially good ones. We also need a good movement action, as our only currently good one is on the other half of an Attack we have to use. So while Darkened Skies provides this cool, powerful effect that would certainly be welcome, it doesn't give us anything we really need.</li><li>It's just not good on some scenarios. Some scenarios will have exclusively high-hp enemies, or high-shield medium/low hp enemies, and it's pretty useless in those scenarios, especially when combined with higher levels/difficulty.</li></ol>"

Solid Bow was a necessary card because we needed both effects early on but now we can easily afford to replace it as we have a number of better non-loss Attacks and some good movement (a Move 5 Jump in Flight of Flame and two Move 3 + bonuses in Wild Command and Camo). An alternative would be to drop Far Pain but the opportunity for Advantage on the attack if the target is doomed makes it slightly stronger than Solid Bow."

That's really perfect - in general, in Gloomhaven, focusing too much on healing will lead to weakening your character, but it's always good to have a bit of healing in most scenarios (the exception to this would be one-room scenarios where you're constantly fighting). Healing is typically not worth doing while in combat as enemy damage will outpace healing and thus you'd be better off killing or disabling enemies. But in between rooms/fights, people will usually be missing some hp and being able to restore some of that before the next fight will lead to losing less cards to negate damage over the course of the scenario, increasing longevity and allowing players to play more losses and thus be more effective. Healing in those situations is perfect with a top action because you'll often spend 1-2 turns moving towards the next door/setting up before you go in, in which case you can move toward the door or grab coins and top up your party.",
          "bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom provides a very nice summon for a level 1 card. Melee summons in Gloomhaven tend to be mostly quite bad because their AI lends itself to them committing suicide quite frequently, but ranged summons don't suffer from nearly as many problems, and while the 2 range on this summon can be a bit limiting, 3 attack per round plus <i>Pierce</i> is a lot of damage, easily allowing this to be your loss that provides the most damage-per-card in many scenarios at early levels.<p>You'll especially find this useful on many boss fights, scenarios where the Spellweaver is typically weaker, assuming you can keep it alive. Whether you can keep it alive or not, in general, will determine how good this summon will be in your party. A strong, tanky front-line is best, but otherwise something like the Cragheart's obstacles or even just the Mindthief's CC can also go a long way.</p>",

If you have a Brute in your party, who can create Air with the bottom of Leaping Cleave for you, you should bring this card at level 1, as in that case you'll be able to set it up before the last room and get 8 attack from a loss, which is much better.

The problem is that we only have a single very early card, Mana Bolt, and it already has an enormous amount of work to do, so we'd be hurting ourselves a lot to have to use it as a move 2 exclusively with this card's combo.",

Accordingly, the third mode for this card, which will be used often enough, is simply a move 2 with 20 initiative. Between having two slightly below-average modes and one highly situational mode, this card does enough to earn its place for a bit. Furthermore, Mana Bolt has such a good bottom (whether heal or move 2) that having this around for the top makes it easier to use Mana Bolt's bottom.</p>"

This design allows for you to use your loss actions twice per scenario instead of once, freeing you up to play them more liberally, which is both fun and powerful. Sadly, that aspect of this class ends up abandoned (assuming you choose to play optimally) as you level, as you'll replace your splashy loss actions with just straight-up better non-loss actions.<p>You'll also need to be very careful with your positioning when you get down to 2-3 cards in your hand to make sure you can actually get the top action here off and not be forced to lose a card and thus probably lose the scenario. The Dark generation on the top is mostly irrelevant but can occasionally be used by the top of Frost Armor or Mana Bolt.</p>",

The most common candidates will be Frost Armor and Aid from the Ether (and later Cold Fire). By first playing a loss and then immediately recovering it the turn you play Reviving Ether's top, you'll end up with 7 cards in your hand instead of 6. That won't add an additional turn in terms of longevity but it will give you more options. Should you choose to keep Reviving Ether's summon active and do the trick with something like the bottom of Frost Armor, it will indeed add an additional turn, as you'll have 6 cards instead of 5, thus it is something worth paying attention to.</p>"

The bottom attack will be missed but with Cold Fire as a payoff we'll have even more incentive to constantly reposition in order to get maximum effectiveness while keeping ourselves safe.</p>"

In my previous version of this guide I did actually recommend taking Living Torch at 6, but after becoming a significantly more experienced player, especially with higher difficulties, I've come to the conclusion that I explained above: I just want to be playing Cold Fire as often and as effectively as I can. Accordingly, while Living Torch is very nice, I'd rather get the bottom of Chromatic for Ice generation now as opposed to next level.</p>That being said, if you do already have the Any Element enhancement, you can take Living Torch now and Chromatic at level 7.</p><p>Forked Beam was here mostly for the initiative and we have a much better bottom action here.</p><p>We could drop Flashing Burst instead,but that can be enhanced to attack 4, range 4, which is much better."

Otherwise, remember that this loss is just 2 attack higher than our standard attacks, which does not merit an early or mid-scenario loss on power level alone.

Obviously that's a lot worse than when we just use one of our attack 5's and get to use a bottom action on top of that but the advantage of this Quick Hands combo is that we don't require allied adjacency on our target, which even in a party with a melee ally, can't always be the case (although in most of those cases, that's when we use our ranged attacks, both because they're more flexible and because it's riskier to approach enemies when we're alone)."

The same rule applies regarding average scenarios, but here even on boss scenarios, it's much more questionable because it's harder to use (you need to be sure, usually in advance, that the boss will start and remain isolated for this bottom action to really be worth the loss).",
          "overall": "While intrinsically the late initiative might seem bad, having at least one really late initiative is actually very helpful for the Scoundrel, allowing for the classic 'run in late, attack, go early the next around with an attack and move out or finish the enemy.' So even what's 'bad' on this card is often good, making it another very good card."

          "top": "The strength of this top action largely depends on your party size and to some extent your party composition. First of all, let's establish that you cannot consistently create Dark without enhancement (the Dark enhancement strategy for the Scoundrel is an interesting idea though, to be sure), you only have Smoke Bomb. And we're only using the Smoke Bomb loss on short/boss scenarios, so on those scenarios can this be a better replacement for Backstab when doing a Smoke Bomb combo? If you're in a party of 4, probably. Obviously if you're in a party of 4 and have at least 2 melee allies, then the answer is definitely. Party of 4 with 1 melee ally is close and really ends up being a judgment call based on how much your ranged allies are willing to work with you (can you get at least one of them to move into melee range). If you can get 2 allies in melee range, then this card is obviously better for the combo than Backstab, if you can't, then stick with Backstab.<p>So it's worthwhile to bring for Smoke Bomb combo scenarios in parties of 4 with 1-2 melee allies. Is it worthwhile for anything other than that? Well, in a 2 player party, never. Obviously the top action can never be good in such a party. Otherwise, if you have an ally who can consistently create Dark, I would absolutely bring this card in a party of 3 or larger. If you don't, I wouldn't, because even in a party of 4, you'd need at least 2 allies next to a target for this even to be an attack 5. And while an attack 5 is good, having 2 allies next to a target and that target not already being dead (obviously excluding bosses, which we addressed above) is quite rare and will usually be far from optimal.</p>",
          "bottom": "Now, after all this discussion of the top action, how is the bottom? It's fine. A move 3 is obviously on the short end for this class but still on the general scale of actions, a move 3 with a small upside is a nice action. How important is this small upside? Again, it depends on your party composition - if you have someone like a Brute as a melee ally, who typically can't go as early as you, you may need this action in order to setup adjacency some amount of the time. If you have a melee ally like a Mindthief, you'll need this very, very rarely. Finally, if your party completely lacks Push, this action can sometimes work to trigger traps, at least until you get level 7, which gives you much more flexibility in that department.",

          "bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom depends on party composition: if your melee ally is a Mindthief, this action will be pretty unnecessary as the Mindthief can approach enemies at similar initiatives to you without a problem.<p>If your melee ally is a Brute, this action will actually be quite good as you can reposition enemies next to the Brute before the Brute goes, which is an issue for him as he can rarely go as early as you in the round. If you have no melee allies this action is also quite good but I wouldn't recommend that situation in general.</p>",

In this case, I think the upside is high enough that the answer is yes. In either situation when we bring this card in, it's going to have a very strong impact on our ability to win the scenario.

Monsters trying to fight against this card is like an old hermit throwing rocks at the Death Star to try to save his world - it's just not happening and it ends with destruction. You even have initiative 2 in order to make sure you always get this off before enemies go. Honestly, this action is completely broken and is one of the two most absurd cards in all the starting classes (alongside Inferno). If scenarios aren't easy for you after you pick this up, you're doing something wrong.,p>Finally, if you ever wondered how good the Scoundrel is at looting, how about you do that math on a beautiful Curse enhancement there quickly and then come back to gape in awe (I would absolutely recommend that Curse enhancement if you can ever afford it, it is also completely broken).</p>"

Otherwise, remember that this loss is just 2 attack higher than our standard attacks, which does not merit an early or mid-scenario loss on power level alone. It can get up to +4 attack with Smoke Bomb, which is a combo we'll try to use on boss fights, but we can never afford two losses outside of those scenarios.</p>"

Great movement and very low initiative.<p>Obviously if you can't consistently get the adjacency bonus, this card's top action gets a lot worse, but again you really don't want to play Scoundrel without being able to get adjacency bonuses most of the time, so I don't think that's a serious consideration we need to make.</p>"

Obviously that's a lot worse than when we just use one of our attack 5's and get to use a bottom action on top of that but the advantage of this Quick Hands combo is that we don't require allied adjacency on our target, which even in a party with a melee ally, can't always be the case (although in most of those cases, that's when we use our ranged attacks, both because they're more flexible and because it's riskier to approach enemies when we're alone)."

          "bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, you'll again pretty rarely play. The same rule applies regarding average scenarios, but here even on boss scenarios, it's much more questionable because it's harder to use (you need to be sure, usually in advance, that the boss will start and remain isolated for this bottom action to really be worth the loss).",
          "overall": "While intrinsically the late initiative might seem bad, having at least one really late initiative is actually very helpful for the Scoundrel, allowing for the classic 'run in late, attack, go early the next around with an attack and move out or finish the enemy.' So even what's 'bad' on this card is often good, making it another very good card."

          "top": "The strength of this top action largely depends on your party size and to some extent your party composition. First of all, let's establish that you cannot consistently create Dark without enhancement (the Dark enhancement strategy for the Scoundrel is an interesting idea though, to be sure), you only have Smoke Bomb. And we're only using the Smoke Bomb loss on short/boss scenarios, so on those scenarios can this be a better replacement for Backstab when doing a Smoke Bomb combo? If you're in a party of 4, probably. Obviously if you're in a party of 4 and have at least 2 melee allies, then the answer is definitely. Party of 4 with 1 melee ally is close and really ends up being a judgment call based on how much your ranged allies are willing to work with you (can you get at least one of them to move into melee range). If you can get 2 allies in melee range, then this card is obviously better for the combo than Backstab, if you can't, then stick with Backstab.<p>So it's worthwhile to bring for Smoke Bomb combo scenarios in parties of 4 with 1-2 melee allies. Is it worthwhile for anything other than that? Well, in a 2 player party, never. Obviously the top action can never be good in such a party. Otherwise, if you have an ally who can consistently create Dark, I would absolutely bring this card in a party of 3 or larger. If you don't, I wouldn't, because even in a party of 4, you'd need at least 2 allies next to a target for this even to be an attack 5. And while an attack 5 is good, having 2 allies next to a target and that target not already being dead (obviously excluding bosses, which we addressed above) is quite rare and will usually be far from optimal.</p>",

A move 3 is obviously on the short end for this class but still on the general scale of actions, a move 3 with a small upside is a nice action. How important is this small upside? Again, it depends on your party composition - if you have someone like a Brute as a melee ally, who typically can't go as early as you, you may need this action in order to setup adjacency some amount of the time. If you have a melee ally like a Mindthief, you'll need this very, very rarely. Finally, if your party completely lacks Push, this action can sometimes work to trigger traps, at least until you get level 7, which gives you much more flexibility in that department.",

          "bottom": "The bottom of this card is super interesting if you are going mass summons. Technically your bear and all your summons have the same initiative, so you can have your bear go before them and tank damage while your summon army follows it and adds their own dmg/poison/etc. If your weak summons take damage, you can siphon that off onto the bear and then use Patch Fur. The weakness of this strategy is both this and patch fur are bottom halves/ so you could be playing with fire as you wait a turn to heal up. Note that this says “allied summons,” so you could use this card to siphon bear HP onto your Spellweaver's Spirit Ally, for example. Also note the Tyrant is included in this pool of health, if you are feeling safe - or if you want to heal yourself using the bear's HP.",

Pop this down on the first turn, then later play something like relentless ally to give your bear an attack 5 with his auto summon attack. Then play a bottom attack 2 to give your bear another attack 5. That's 10 damage on a turn. Later when the bear gets a multi-attack bottom we start wreaking havoc. The movement part might be useful if your move commands are in your discard, but usually we want the +3 attack.",

The issue is you want to do damage when your bear is next to something, but if your bear is surrounded, this is a fine option before moving him away and regrouping.",
          "bottom": "The bottom of this card literally breaks multiple scenarios. Does the scenario require you to grab a treasure in the back of a huge room with 4 groups of enemies? Swap your invisible scoundrel with the baddie in the back and beat the scenario in 3 turns (have actually done this). Is the boss behind tons of traps and enemies? Swap them for the skeleton you've surrounded in the other room. It also allows your bear to act as a proxy in escape scenarios, as you can move your bear to the escape zone and swap yourself there.",

Generally you don't want to be pushing people away from your bear, but if you get 2 attacks in and then you can push your target into a trap, this is a good card. Give it some thought if you see 4+ trap tokens being pulled during setup. Adding Immobilize to the bottom of this neutralises a melee enemy if you pair the card with an early initiative.",

          "overall": "If you are starting at level 1 with this character and running a bear style, you will take this card because the “x” cards are generally summon/hybrid cards. The hybrid build gets less out of this, though the bottom still has value to give the bear focus on what he attacks."

          "The Beast Tyrant's greatest strength is on the player board: two health bars! This is by far the most health of any class in the game. It makes you an effective tank, and especially good at taking true damage from things like retaliate, traps or wounds. The goal of an Active Tyrant build is to use both your health bars as a resource. This is the fundamental principle of the build: get in there with both figures so that you can use both crowd control and melee attacks effectively. Rotate aggro between the bear and the Tyrant, or split them up at opposite sides of a room. Stick behind your allies and use your buffs to make them even better, or open a door and disarm the enemies to give your bear a turn to catch up. You can be in two places at once with this build. You can pick up loot like a ranged attacker while blocking the hallways like a melee attacker. You can stand next to your bear to become living obstacles, causing enemies to stand still because they can't reach you. It does everything! Except, you know, attack for 15 in one turn.",
          "As a summoner class, long rests have a natural advantage for you, because the bear will still move and attack while you are resting, and Initiative 99 will help your allies draw aggro from a bear who is dangerously low on health. Each long rest heals the Tyrant - not the bear - for 2, so if he hasn't taken damage, you're wasting resources.",
          "Remember that most items benefit only your character, not the bear. While items that affect allies can certainly be helpful, as an Active Tyrant you can also use normal armour, weapons and potions effectively. A healing potion is just as good for you as for a Brute, if you've taken enough damage.",
          "A hand size of 10 cards is average, but since you rarely play loss cards, you will often find yourself outlasting other party members. This gives you a cushion to lose cards to avoid damage, particularly to keep the bear alive."
        ],
        "benefits": [
          "The bear is the biggest benefit of this class due to the following:",
          "The bear's starting stats are excellent. Attack 2 is not amazing, but Move 3 is generally fast enough combined with just one command movement to ensure your bear always reaches the fight in time. If your allies have cards that affect summons or grant actions to others, the bear is almost always a good target.",
          "Note that since you summon the bear into an adjacent hex on Turn 0, it can start outside of the normal starting position. This is a significant advantage, allowing it to take the focus of even the fastest enemies, and generally reach enemies on turn one without any extra help.",
          "The key to playing a Beast Tyrant properly is making sure the bear goes where you want her to go. (The bear doesn't have an official gender; I'll use female to differentiate bear from the Tyrant, who is male.) This means you need to understand the monster AI intimately, because most of the time, you won't have the luxury of playing command cards to move her around. You or your allies can stand in suboptimal hexes next to the closest enemy so that the bear moves past you; you can block the doorway so that the bear doesn't rush past you and die to a hail of arrows; or your allies can move enemies around to more useful positions, like with the Scoundrel's Sinister Opportunity."

This class doesn't really have enough payoffs for being under half-life to make this top a compelling action. While the top does theoretically get better as you lose some life and spend less life each time you do this, if you're bringing this card to a scenario, it's going to be for the bottom, so the card shouldn't be hanging around later for the top to have its time to shine.",
          "bottom": "The real selling point of this card is the bottom, which can be pretty crazy. In general, this bottom also gets better with levels, as you'll have a larger HP pool to spend and you'll have more AoE Attacks that scale with this buff, making it both more rewarding and less risky. At low levels, I wouldn't recommend using this buff unless you have a party that can either mitigate most damage for you or you have a semi-dedicated healer like a Tinkerer. With those conditions met, you can try this bottom from low levels (especially when you get your level 2/3 cards), otherwise, this will show back up at significantly higher level.",

Move 3 is a lot better than a Move 2; the self-Heal is great for removing Poison and Wound, which are both quite dangerous for us, as well as giving us a bit more of our primary resource to spend; and we can use this bottom alongside Resolute Stand top, or if we use Resolute Stand top, we'll still have this excellent bottom around.",

And obviously, in most cases, an enemy in melee range getting to take its turn will cost more than two life, especially as the levels increase, meaning the price of the Stun here is almost always worth it. This also has even better initiative, allowing you to stun most enemies before they'll go.",

Negating damage to not die is something very core to this class, typically done through the base mechanic of losing cards from hand to negate damage and this card gives us a 3-for-1 discount on that at the price of also having to play it as a bottom action. And unlike other classes' damage-negation loss cards with charges, this one will mostly only activate when we want it to, so it should rarely be wasted, which is great. The card also has above average initiative for this class.",

It really depends on your party whether you can let yourself drop life quickly or not, so gauging the value you'll get from the top is difficult in the abstract (the more tanking/healing/crowd control your party has, the safer it is to drop your life total). And while we could play the bottom loss whenever we want, obviously it's better to avoid losing the card until later in the scenario when the effect will actually trigger. The biggest shame is that we also don't get to play this top action while having the bottom active. Thus, a card with two powerful halves is just fine overall.</p>"

If you have another tank you may occasionally use this on them as well. What's funny about this top loss is that it's a level 1 card that's typically a lot better at high levels than low levels. Whether you find this to be an essential tool or not will just depend on how much healing your party members can do. ",

Any bottom Move action that has an additional effect where we can enhance Strengthen can be inherently broken and this is no exception with 9 initiative being stellar for this class. So, first of all, why? Well, when you gain a condition, you gain it until the end of your next turn, which means that if we gain Strengthen during our turn, it affects the rest of this turn and the next one. Accordingly, we can use a bottom like this before attacking, have Advantage on all of our Attacks this round and next round. And for a short math preview: with just 6 perks, Advantage adds basically +1 damage to all of our Attacks as well as significantly increasing the predictability (like knowing that we won't miss or we'll most likely draw a +1 or better). Move 2 is rather limiting, but fortunately they make boots for that (more on that later).",

And even without Blood Pact, the bottom is honestly good. You should mostly look at this bottom action as a Move 2, Attack 2 and only occasionally worry about the AoE targeting. AoE targeting on such a low-damage Attack is risky because you don't want to get into melee range of that many enemies and not kill/CC them. Sometimes it will come up, and you'll be happy to have it. Additionally, you can use this bottom with the top of Break the Chains to set it up quite easily if you get into proper position the round before.",
          "overall": "But aside from the ideal situations, just having a Move 2, Attack 2 with 16 initiative on this class is honestly quite welcome."

First of all, adding another non-Move bottom action is definitely welcome as we currently have two Move 4(+)'s, one Move 4, and two Move 3's, meaning we have all the movement we need. Guaranteed Advantage for your Attacks (all your Attacks, too bad we can't have this alongside the other level 4 card - or maybe we can...) and Disadvantage for all Attacks targeting you is just a small difference on both ends that adds up.",

We should take it for that reason alone.<p>This card also has very early initiative which is great for a non-Move bottom as we'll be attacking without moving and it's good to be able to kill the enemies near us before they go. The initiative is also important for guaranteeing that we have this buff before monsters attack us and thus they do, in fact, get disadvantaged. Finally, creating Fire is not insignificant as we currently have two Fire spenders and only one card which makes Fire, meaning we can now use both, which is a nice little bonus. Like I said, this card really just does a lot of little things. The only strike against this card is the eventual enhancements we'll do on the bottom of Resolute Stand and Bounce Back, which should already give us enough Advantaged Attacks. But conveniently, having this top as a Loot action around will get us to those enhancements sooner, meaning it sort of replaces itself.</p>"

As the guide progresses, I will assume some enhancements, namely Strengthen on the bottom of Bounce Back and Resolute Stand, as well as Jump on the bottom of Strength in Agony. If you haven't done all of those enhancements, those cards obviously won't be as important as the guide portrays. By now, you should certainly have at least one of the Strengthen enhancements done (first on Bounce Back - see the enhancements section further down), but if you don't have the other, you can cut Resolute Stand on non-boss scenarios in favour of the most recently-cut card (in this case Dazing Wound, for example).",

If your party has a good amount of healing that can come your way when you need it, just add Burning Hatred and Blood Pact at this level and leave it at that.<p>If your party lacks healing, it's time to bring From the Brink back as well. From the Brink has also scaled incredibly well with your 22+ hp pool from now on and will give you that mid-scenario recharge you desperately need in party compositions that don't involve healers. From the Brink should replace Shiny Distraction. By now, hopefully you have both Resolute Stand and Bounce Back enhanced with Strengthen. If you don't, you'll just replace Resolute Stand here instead outside of boss fights (and Flurry in boss fights as it's typically not very good there). Shiny Distraction is a better card than Break the Chains, but we're too bottom-action heavy to be able to afford to replace a top action. And having a turn 1 ranged top Attack to be played alongside Blood Pact is very nice.</p>It should be noted that you still remain somewhat bottom action heavy and lack non-loss top actions at this point. You'll definitely want to try to lose bottom actions, not top ones, on rests. And for the rest cycles (like the first) where you're already skewed, it's fine because you naturally want to Stamina Potion back Burning Hatred and Devil Horns anyway, as they're your two best non-loss actions and they go together on back-to-back turns.<p>Finally, one additional suggestion that I consider very reasonable courtesy of /u/caiusdrewart: you can consider replacing Break the Chains with Cauterize from here on. The upside of this is being able to Burning Hatred turn 2 without needing help from allies/items. That is a pretty big upside in difficult first rooms. I typically like to go turn 2 Devil Horns + bottom Strengthen, then turn 3 Burning Hatred + Spiked Armor but I acknowledge this is a slower start until turn 3, which might be time your party doesn't have. Taking Cauterize over Break the Chains will also typically be a bit worse after the first rest cycle unless you have item 79, in which case you should have already made the swap. Feel free to experiment with both options depending on the needs of your party and the scenario.</p>",

First of all, you've now got a 22 max hp pool, meaning you can let Blood Pact go for a long time without it being a problem. More importantly, Burning Hatred just makes Blood Pact sooooo much better (to be clear, this entire time I'm referring to Blood Pact bottom - play the bottom ASAP in scenarios, please continue to ignore the top). So Blood Pact replaces Unbridled Power, mostly just because we need the Fire for Burning Hatred (Unbridled Power was still perfectly fine)."

One-shot losses scale poorly in Gloomhaven and while Flurry was very strong for a loss, it's not exception. Our average expected damage on Advantaged Attacks (which is most of our Attacks, and certainly should be all of your Flurry Attacks) hasn't increased since our 6th perk, so the damage here really just isn't scaling up. We've now got Burning Hatred for a similar non-loss effect, as well as Maw, meaning we really just don't need this anymore. And while it was still a good Move card, Strength in Agony provides all the movement we could ever want (obviously you can consider bringing Flurry back in for scenarios where you really have to run a lot, like 'escape' scenarios).</p>"

          "bottom": "We want the Move 3's we have access to, and this one comes with the best upside yet. A free small Heal that can help top people off but mostly serves as free Wound/Poison removal.<p>The Earth doesn't matter to us but can be used by an ally, so it is certainly helpful some amount of the time.</p>",
          "overall": "Care Package is great, although I still have difficulty visualizing exactly what's being thrown and to whom exactly.<p>The top feels great to use when it works out, and for all the times that the top doesn't line up, the bottom is obviously great.</p><p>An excellent spammable bottom paired with a valuable-if-situational top combines for a card that we're super happy to have.</p>"

Center Mass top will be your most common initial Favourite delivery method when doing single-target damage, which you'll then follow with Attacks that benefit from having The Favourite in the target.",
          "bottom": "This class really does want Move 3's (as you don't have any non-conditional Move 4's), and this bottom provides one with a reasonable and sometimes useful upside at good enough initiative. At low levels, you'll use the top of this card a lot more than the bottom, but as you level, both halves will become essential.",
          "overall": "Center Mass is just an excellent card for this class, with very usable top and bottom actions that we can use at any level. The top scales better than expected because 24 initiative is actually quite good for this class."

          "bottom": "Similarly, the bottom is only good if you start your turn next to an enemy, but you're not a tanky class, so you don't want to let enemies come up and hit you, and you lack late enough initiatives to Move next to an enemy the previous round then do this the following round (and you lack very early initiatives to combine with this, and it's just a lot of work for a small payoff).",
          "overall": "So overall, not a good card. That being said, I do think it's worth bringing to scenarios with large numbers of small enemies, like Vermling Scouts. Those enemies die quickly enough that the top is less risky, they don't hit very hard to punish you, and there are enough of them that you'll typically satisfy the targeting condition. But aside from specific scenarios that really want AoE because of enemy types, you're better off leaving this one on the sidelines."

That seems like it might be better, but in truth, long range isn't necessarily very useful for us because we want to make most of our Attacks with The Favourite or targeting enemies that already have it in them and we typically want to keep The Favourite closer to use to make it easier to get back. That's not to say that long range can't sometimes be useful.",

          "overall": "So basically, you certainly want either this or Stopping Power and you don't want both. I'm going to be honest with you all, I'm truly not sure which one is better. Personally, I prefer Stopping Power just because an Attack 3, Range 2 is typically going be reasonably better than an Attack 2, Range 3 for when you lose the Wind generator first in the scenario. But some people whose opinions I really respect prefer Extra Lift, so they may be right. I've actually started tracking this while using Stopping Power and across 6 scenarios thus far, there have been two instances where Extra Lift would have been better, but that's also not to say Stopping Power has been better all the rest of the time (I haven't tracked the reverse instances where it was better, sadly)."

And, of course, you can throw The Favourite at one of the targets to get the extra damage needed to finish them off. In scenarios where you're immediately in a tough spot in the first room, you'll often want to go with this combo turn 1 over The Favourite, and look to play The Favourite the following turn when you have a bit more breathing room.",
          "overall": "Fancy Hat is great, although really as the second part of a one-two punch with Disorienting Barrage, not on its own.

Move 3 + element is a standard excellent Gloomhaven action when you want the element, and you can certainly use Wind, even if it's not really incredible.

First of all, this lets you both pick up The Favourite but also grab some bonus coins. But the biggest draw here is that you can grab The Favourite and use it in the same turn.<p>If you Attack before moving, typically you can just use a larger Move to get to the hex where you killed the target and Loot The Favourite at the end of your turn.

Accordingly, you need to make sure that when you use it, you target enemies in spots you can get to shortly after. Typically, Hatchet focuses down enemies in a front-to-back fashion, or around the edges of the fight. Killing an enemy in the back with The Favourite is a recipe to be ineffective for a number of turns afterwards, especially as the bottom of The Favourite is your only Jump.

Ultimately, you're pretty much always going to be better off just using top Attacks to apply it and then get the payoff for it across two turns while moving or doing a better non-Move bottom (specifically one that has better initiative).

I've had this happen a couple times, but it's reasonably uncommon. The real draw of this card is the bottom action.</p><p>I'm actually sort of overselling the card without mentioning the real reason this card is decent: the initiative. Currently, our three fastest initiatives are 12, 24, and 30. Adding a 20 in is a big improvement and the value of early initiative cannot possibly be overemphasized, especially on a class that looks to prevent enemy Attacks by killing them before they go. Thus, the reason we'll be willing to take this otherwise-mediocre card is just because it has a spammable bottom with attractive initiative (literally the best initiative we've been offered at levels 2-4)</p>."

It doesn't matter too much in the end as we're going to take the other card at level 3.<p>Repeat Shot replaces Second Wind, which was just there as filler. Still, for high-movement scenarios, you can consider bringing back Second Wind to replace Stopping Power (and then the Wind on the bottom of Power Pitch will get used on the bottom of Follow Through, which also makes sense for a scenario where you want movement).</p>"

Obviously if there are good traps and your party doesn't have any other good sources of forced movement, you could bring it back, but most characters in Jaws are better at forced movement than you anyway, so it shouldn't typically be an issue. Power Pitch without Stopping Power is still fine as another Move 3 that can sometimes help with the bottom of Follow Through.</p>"

Neither card is much better than the other when discounting initiative, and Overwatch may even be slightly better, but our initiatives are not good and initiative is extremely important in Gloomhaven. Thus, at level 4, we take Ripped from the Flesh, although if you swapped the initiatives on these two cards, we would obviously take Overwatch instead.<p>Ripped from the Flesh replaces Power Pitch. You should still bring in Power Pitch and Double Throw for boss scenarios, cutting Fancy Hat and Barrage, and for scenarios where you need a lot of movement again cut Hat and Barrage for Second Wind and Power Pitch.</p>"

Well, you see, you just don't have any early initiative top ranged attacks so you can't pair this with an early card to place the obstacles when you can still predict what they'll do. And finally, the Earth generation continues to not be a priority as we'll have two cards from level 1 and three cards from level 4 that create Earth all the time.</p>",

If your party was really heavily relying on your healing (lacking other people who can bring a little healing), you can cut Crater on scenarios without valuable traps. Avalanche is, unfortunately, by far our worst card and still in our hand, but it's just necessary at this point on many scenarios to make Clear the Way even function.<p></p>"

Thus, we take Meteor with very little intention of regularly playing the top action.<p>Meteor replaces Backup Ammo. Everything about Backup Ammo was still good but Meteor had to come in somewhere and we are getting some other loss cards we almost always want to play, giving Backup Ammo less opportunities. If you want to cheese scenarios you can always bring Backup Ammo back when you get level 9 to pair with Blind Destruction, but honestly Blind Destruction is already such a broken card that I find you shouldn't have too much issue anyway once you have access to that card (especially if you're playing with Stamina Potions).</p>"

The only awkward part is that we're better-served if we damage but don't kill enemies, allowing our teammates to finish them off after us, but at the same time we can't consistently go early, so many times we won't get the Curse. In those cases, don't fret and just realize that killing enemies to prevent them from attacking is basically the same as getting the Curse immediately.",

This card does scale worse than Biting Gnats, which might seem counter-intuitive as it deals more damage, but as enemy health bars scale upwards, it becomes less realistic that we'll be killing the enemies and they'll be doing a lot of damage relative to our tiny health pool if we're in such short range with multiple still-alive foes.

Otherwise, when that's not the case, you'll find yourself frequently needing to play the card as a default Attack 2 or Move 2 (on most classes that's mostly Move 2), which means you're losing effectiveness every time you play that card (unless you desperately need the initiative and the initiative here is not good).",

And while we will get a non-loss source of Air at level 3, it's very costly to not get to regularly use the other half of that card, meaning we'd really not be able to take advantage of this card until level 6.

Absolutely, to a degree. This top does what Convert the Flock top wants to do - it gives us a very nice head start on our Curses, which is a weakness of this class (being a bit slow-starting).",

It's easy for you to maintain a steady level of Curses around this number once you get there, but it's more annoying to steadily climb up to there, which makes this action quite valuable. The great thing then about this top is that it rapidly obsoletes itself, as once you get to a high Curse density in the enemy deck, you don't need to play it anymore (and avoid the high cost). Thus, it's an excellent action that you'll play once or twice per scenario (in the first room or in the first and second rooms), be thankful it was there, and then avoid using it any further (either by losing it at a rest or using the bottom).</p>"

					"top": "The top is one of your two level 1 AoEs and has its positives and negatives. The positive is that it has an upside of 6 damage, which is a ton for level 1. Otherwise, even just hitting 2 enemies for 2 each and gaining 1 XP is quite good for a level 1 card. On the other hand, however, there are some problems with this type of large area low damage melee AoE. First of all, in order to maximize the value of this attack, you need to get next to 2-3 enemies. Even the tank build doen't want to actively search out enemies to hit you. And because the damage of this AoE is so low, you're unlikely to actually kill them unless they're already quite weak, meaning they will need to be dealt with or they will all hit you for more damage than this attack is worth. The good news is that you have a number of early initiative cards, so you can very realistically go before your allies and then rely on them to finish off most of the enemies you hit with this, so you don't get messed up when the monsters go. This still also requires your allies to go early in the round and this sort of move can get very heavily punished by a couple of bad attack modifier draws by your and/or your allies. Thus, there's a lot that has to be done in order to make this work. Secondly, because of the low damage on this attack, it scales very poorly as monster level increases, also because the monsters will hit for more damage if you don't kill them, making it even more punishing and less likely to be worth it. Fortunately, at higher levels, modifier decks tend to be more reliable so you should have an accurate enough assessment of whether you can make it work or not.",
					"bottom": "Regardless of the weakness of the top attack, it does have a high potential upside, and as usual that's well-complimented by a good move 4 on the bottom.",
					"overall": "Cleaving Axe is a good card with a pretty good AoE and a nice move."
				},
				{
					"id": "cripplingbow",
					"top": "Attack 3 range 3 with 1 XP is just perfectly fine and something you'll usually be happy to use, especially on the early levels. Again, if you've played the Brute before this you know how often you used his ranged attack. Ranged attacks are just really good in this game because range can effectively function like healing against a lot of enemies by keeping you out of range of their attacks.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is another attack on bottom which we'll use as crowd control to prevent an enemy from getting in range to attack. Immobilize is unfortunately not great against a number of the more threatening enemies in the game, but it certainly has its uses. And by being a situational bottom attached to a top we're always happy to use, we pay nothing for the pleasure.",
					"overall": "Crippling Bow is another above average card. The ability to force flying enemies to move around objects and be subject to traps adds real value to this card in some scenarios.<p>Sadly, especially for a card with crowd control, it does suffer from middling initiative.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "crushinghammer",
					"top": "Admittedly, attack 3 stun is pretty mediocre for a loss effect, but having the option around can sometimes be helpful, especially when it costs you nothing as you'd always want this bottom anyway. In reality, the top more likely reads 'gain 2 experience at the end of the scenario.'",
					"bottom": "And the bottom really is great for a level 1 card. Move 2 isn't a ton, and it does hurt a bit that you can't actually enhance the move to increase it by 1 (actually a common trend for the Quartermaster and probably his biggest downside - he has very few cards that can be meaningfully enhanced, probably because his cards are already so good), but adding a free shield 1 self on makes a world of difference. In reality, you can more look at this like the move 2 is tacked on to a shield 1. For example, the Brute has a level 1 card that is JUST shield 1 self with 15 initiative. Here you have move 2 shield 1 self at 17 initiative, and obviously that's just night and day better. The added 2 move allows you to move from one enemy to another when you're already in a room fighting a group of enemies, while also mitigating damage you'd take by being in the thick of things. And of course having such great initiative on the card makes it so you'll almost always get the shield up before enemies can go.",
					"overall": "Crashing Hammer is a perfect implementation of a loss card - one powerful situational effect combined with one spammable effect.<p>It's actually interesting to me that this is an 'X' card for the Quartermaster while the shield 1 self card is a '1' for the Brute. That could indicate that tanking isn't necessarily something core for the Quartermaster, compared to the Brute, but the QM actually has a better tanking perk than the Brute does. Anyway, just an interesting thought, but I do consider this card to be incredibly core for this class.</p>"

					"id": "hastenedstep",
					"top": "The top is essentially attack 4, move 1. Of course, at level 1 it will be almost strictly worse than attack 4 just because of the existence of shield and your modifier deck won't be that good yet. Eventually, as your modifier deck improves, this will get to be significantly better than attack 4. And of course throwing the move 1 in between the two attacks, rather than at the end, gives a lot more flexibility most of the time.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is a move 5. What more is there to say about that? Move 5 is exceptional as a bottom on level 1 cards. 'Ugh, I'm only going to be able to move 5 this turn with my level 1 non-loss card' said no one ever.",
					"overall": "Hastened Step could be a level 3 card for many classes and you'd still be happy to take it (it could be a level 7 card for the Music Note class and you'd love it). This card does it all - two great halves and good initiative.<p>You'll pretty much always want to keep this card no matter what you're doing with this class and you'll be happy whichever half you're using - the only bad part is that you can't use both halves each time.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "impalingspear",
					"top": "Now Impaling Spear is an AoE I can get behind. At its worst it's basically an attack 3 range 2 with no adjacency disadvantage that gives 1 XP, which is already quite fine. With our very good amount of move cards, it's not too difficult to line two enemies up for this and get its maximum value of 6 attack. Furthermore, it's much safer than our other AoE as it only needs 2 enemies, not 3, for maximum value, and one of them doesn't even need to be adjacent to us. It also scales better at higher levels for these reasons and because of its higher damage.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, it's complemented by nearly the perfect bottom (come on, this couldn't also be a move 5?), another move 4, for when we need movement, don't have 2 enemies to hit or have a better attack for just a single enemy",

				},
				{
					"id": "ironbulwark",
					"top": "First, the top: attack 3 that gives 1 XP is already decent for level 1, and Muddle is just a small added bonus that does help us to mitigate damage occasionally. Nothing flashy about this half, just a solid workhorse of an above average but not incredible card.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom which compares so favourably to the aforementioned Shield Bash. Not only do we get shield 1, but our allies do as well. Works well with summons and is part of the reason why it's fine to have 2 tanks with this class, because cards like this benefit both tanks significantly.",
					"overall": "Iron Bulwark, another level 1 card that puts the Brute's Shield Bash to shame with its bottom.<p>Early initiative again makes it likely that we can get this buff up before enemies attack.</p>"

				{
					"id": "oversizedpack",
					"top": "A non-loss loot 2, on top! Wow, that's really great. You can move and still do a loot 2, which until you've experienced a well-positioned loot 2 first-hand (let me assure you, it's glorious), you have no idea just how large loot 2 is. Sadly, we can't regularly use loot cards as they're only good a few times per scenario, at most. The ability to move after the loot does give some additional utility as a top move can be valuable.",
					"bottom": "eanwhile, the bottom is another Quartermaster effect that is unimpressive at level 1 but gets better at higher levels. As we only have 1 consumable item at level 1, this effect is not even remotely worth a loss. By level 7, when you can have 4 consumable items, it starts to get quite tempting, especially with very high Prosperity consumables that have really powerful effects (with high Prosperity I might even consider this effect worth it at level 5). Still, regardless of how good this effect might eventually become at a certain level, the card will always be mediocre at best just because you have no half you can regularly use.",
					"overall": "Oversized Pack is one of those cards with two powerful but unfortunately situational halves stapled together that means the whole is less than the sum of its parts.<p>Having to use a move 2 with 81 initiative for a significant chunk of the scenario just to occasionally get these powerful effects will usually not be worth it.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "proficiency",
					"top": "This top isn't really a situational loss, it's more of a 'play around me' loss that you'll either want to use early in each scenario or not bother bringing it. In order for this effect really to go off for you and thus justify itself, you really want a level 5 card. Until then, I don't think this is worth it. And even then, that level 5 card is also a loss that if you use that combo, only really being worth it on smaller/shorter scenarios (can be great for boss fights). After that, this card also gets better at much higher levels as you get some very large but low damage AoEs, and every +1 attack can make a huge difference on those. Still, at level 1 this is usually best left on the side-lines.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is fine as a move 3, although with poor initiative on a pretty fast class it's still below average. And, unlike other situational loss cards, the fact that you want to use this loss early makes spammable move on the bottom less relevant.",

				},
				{
					"id": "reservedenergy",
					"top": "The top is a relatively powerful support effect, only let down by the question of 'when exactly do I want to use this?' What I mean is, the most common time we use support cards are when enemies are either all or mostly dead and we're moving from one room to another. But in those situations, you can usually just long rest anyway if you really need to refresh spent items. Otherwise, we use support cards on allies who are in 'deep shit,' but generally healing will be more generically useful for those allies, as well as just attacking to kill enemies that threaten our ally. Thus, while a reasonable effect, especially for a non-loss, you may not find as many situations where this half is actually that useful.",
					"bottom": "Still, it's basically free to have it around because it's tied to a move 4.",

The value of this effect will mostly depend on the size of your group - terrible at 2, mediocre at 3, good at 4. It will also be a bit affected by Prosperity, as again consumable items get much better. Is it worth a loss for a class with 11 cards? Sometimes, although probably not that often depending on scenario length.",
					"bottom": "Fortunately, it doesn't cost much to keep that effect around as we're quite happy to take this card for the bottom only. In general, it's quite a good idea to keep at least one reasonably-sized attack on bottom for those times when you want to make sure to finish off an adjacent enemy. As long as you have enough other good move cards, which the QM does, you can easily get away with it. And while a simple attack 3 is nothing to write home about, as our best level 1 bottom attack it is quite welcome.",

					"bottom": "The downside for this card though, other than maybe the worst initiative in the game, is that the bottom isn't great at early levels until we can improve our attack modifiers. However, pulling 3 attack modifier cards in a few levels time can be very powerful and something we are happy to do. In the meantime grounding 3 flying enemies can make some scenarios much easier.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is another type of support - the best kind. You have a number of ranged attacks so it's very easy to use this bottom without moving, especially at higher levels where you have some giant AoEs making the payoff for this amazing. Otherwise, it will add 1 to your ranged attack, and thanks to good initiative, will be easy to play before your allies to likewise buff them. Remember that effects like this function like 'auras' in other games, which means that your allies have to be in range when they attack to get the buff, regardless of where you were in relation to them when you played this card. That actually works perfectly for you as you're a tank, so you'll be closer to the enemies than your allies most of the time. Thus, your allies can move up near you after you've gone and get the buff.",

For that reason these sort of effects are typically better as a top, which can be used in the aforementioned scenarios in conjunction with movement, but it's still going to be worth it sometimes.",

Unfortunately, once you start passing it around, it won't be for long, as your previously-mentioned card hand limit isn't extremely conducive to loss cards, especially not loss cards that demand additional discards to have an effect. Still, the effect can be EXTREMELY powerful, so if this is everything you've dreamed of doing, go for it.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, we get another attack on bottom, which at attack 3 on a level 4 card isn't great, is still there for free with this top. And adding Muddle does obviously make it slightly better in those cases where we don't kill off an enemy (or can be used to hit a second enemy after we finish the first with our top attack).",

					"top": "Side Pouch gives a sudden large boost to one ally. The effect is definitely very powerful and can absolutely be worth a loss card. Again, as before, this gets better at higher levels when your allies have more consumable items and at higher Prosperity when you have more powerful items to refresh. The effect is very situational regardless and will usually be held for close to the end of the scenario but that's fine because of such a great spammable bottom.",
					"bottom": "Move 3 loot 1 is just awesome to use. Where'd all that money go? Yeah, that's right, you got it. Adding a loot action on top of a very reasonable move makes it so easy to grab that cash without any added effort, which is normally meant to be the trade-off you have to make to pick up money. Even for the damage-dealing build, Side Pouch is super tempting just for this bottom action (because who doesn't want more money?).",
					"overall": "One thing to watch out for if you're saying 'well, I'm going to go the support build, not the damage build he's suggesting because that's what my party wants/needs' is not to just take all the support cards without thinking about it because they're support cards. There are three reasons for this: first, many of them are loss cards and you'll end up with too many loss cards you want to play without being able to play them all. Second, there's some negative synergy - for example, if you have Continual Supply going, you may get less value out of sharing your Side Pouch with someone. Lastly, if you clog up your hand with a bunch of support cards, you won't be able to consistently actually DO something, and your party may be pretty unhappy with the number of times you can't just help them kill something instead of passing them the Pouch. If you do want to take more support cards than I suggest, make sure it's only as a compliment to damage cards, not instead of."

Being 2 direct damage is great too because the problem with small damage attacks is shield, and a bunch of enemies that have low hp pools tend to have high shield values. The biggest problem is that it is just 2 damage, meaning you'll probably kill almost nothing, just soften up a bunch of things. Still, with many rooms in which this can easily deal out 20 damage or more, you'll find the numbers well worth it (especially at larger party numbers).",
					"bottom": "And to compliment this very powerful but situational card you've got an amazing spammable bottom. Move 3 is fine and adding a non-loss stun is almost too good to be true. Much like Crushing Hammer did at level 1, this allows you to manoeuvre around rooms where you're already engaged with enemies, stun an enemy to negate a significant amount of damage and then still get to use a top attack.

That sort of effect was pretty decent for the Tinkerer because he has 12 cards and most of his actions suck. We have just 9 cards and amazing actions, if anything, someone should do this for us, not the other way around.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, as much as I like free crowd-control on bottom move actions, letting the enemies get next to you first in order for it to work just isn't that way to do that.

You will almost always hit 2 enemies with this and routinely hit 3, making this attack 8-12 on average with the only requirement being movement. Yeah, that's good enough.",
					"bottom": "The bottom, while not something you'll use much, does come in handy occasionally. It might seem like this is what's needed to make Catastrophic Bomb fine even on scenarios with lots of Shielded enemies, but that means we don't get Sharpening Kit, and unfortunately that just doesn't work.

				{
					"id": "cleavingaxe",
					"top": "The top is one of your two level 1 AoEs and has its positives and negatives. The positive is that it has an upside of 6 damage, which is a ton for level 1. Otherwise, even just hitting 2 enemies for 2 each and gaining 1 XP is quite good for a level 1 card. On the other hand, however, there are some problems with this type of large area low damage melee AoE. First of all, in order to maximize the value of this attack, you need to get next to 2-3 enemies. Even the tank build doen't want to actively search out enemies to hit you. And because the damage of this AoE is so low, you're unlikely to actually kill them unless they're already quite weak, meaning they will need to be dealt with or they will all hit you for more damage than this attack is worth. The good news is that you have a number of early initiative cards, so you can very realistically go before your allies and then rely on them to finish off most of the enemies you hit with this, so you don't get messed up when the monsters go. This still also requires your allies to go early in the round and this sort of move can get very heavily punished by a couple of bad attack modifier draws by your and/or your allies. Thus, there's a lot that has to be done in order to make this work. Secondly, because of the low damage on this attack, it scales very poorly as monster level increases, also because the monsters will hit for more damage if you don't kill them, making it even more punishing and less likely to be worth it. Fortunately, at higher levels, modifier decks tend to be more reliable so you should have an accurate enough assessment of whether you can make it work or not.",
					"bottom": "Regardless of the weakness of the top attack, it does have a high potential upside, and as usual that's well-complimented by a good move 4 on the bottom.",
					"overall": "Cleaving Axe is a good card with a pretty good AoE and a nice move."
				},
				{
					"id": "cripplingbow",
					"top": "Attack 3 range 3 with 1 XP is just perfectly fine and something you'll usually be happy to use, especially on the early levels. Again, if you've played the Brute before this you know how often you used his ranged attack. Ranged attacks are just really good in this game because range can effectively function like healing against a lot of enemies by keeping you out of range of their attacks.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is another attack on bottom which we'll use as crowd control to prevent an enemy from getting in range to attack. Immobilize is unfortunately not great against a number of the more threatening enemies in the game, but it certainly has its uses. And by being a situational bottom attached to a top we're always happy to use, we pay nothing for the pleasure.",
					"overall": "Crippling Bow is another above average card. The ability to force flying enemies to move around objects and be subject to traps adds real value to this card in some scenarios.<p>Sadly, especially for a card with crowd control, it does suffer from middling initiative.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "crushinghammer",
					"top": "Admittedly, attack 3 stun is pretty mediocre for a loss effect, but having the option around can sometimes be helpful, especially when it costs you nothing as you'd always want this bottom anyway. In reality, the top more likely reads 'gain 2 experience at the end of the scenario.'",
					"bottom": "And the bottom really is great for a level 1 card. Move 2 isn't a ton, and it does hurt a bit that you can't actually enhance the move to increase it by 1 (actually a common trend for the Quartermaster and probably his biggest downside - he has very few cards that can be meaningfully enhanced, probably because his cards are already so good), but adding a free shield 1 self on makes a world of difference. In reality, you can more look at this like the move 2 is tacked on to a shield 1. For example, the Brute has a level 1 card that is JUST shield 1 self with 15 initiative. Here you have move 2 shield 1 self at 17 initiative, and obviously that's just night and day better. The added 2 move allows you to move from one enemy to another when you're already in a room fighting a group of enemies, while also mitigating damage you'd take by being in the thick of things. And of course having such great initiative on the card makes it so you'll almost always get the shield up before enemies can go.",
					"overall": "Crashing Hammer is a perfect implementation of a loss card - one powerful situational effect combined with one spammable effect.<p>It's actually interesting to me that this is an 'X' card for the Quartermaster while the shield 1 self card is a '1' for the Brute. That could indicate that tanking isn't necessarily something core for the Quartermaster, compared to the Brute, but the QM actually has a better tanking perk than the Brute does. Anyway, just an interesting thought, but I do consider this card to be incredibly core for this class.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "hastenedstep",
					"top": "The top is essentially attack 4, move 1. Of course, at level 1 it will be almost strictly worse than attack 4 just because of the existence of shield and your modifier deck won't be that good yet. Eventually, as your modifier deck improves, this will get to be significantly better than attack 4. And of course throwing the move 1 in between the two attacks, rather than at the end, gives a lot more flexibility most of the time.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is a move 5. What more is there to say about that? Move 5 is exceptional as a bottom on level 1 cards. 'Ugh, I'm only going to be able to move 5 this turn with my level 1 non-loss card' said no one ever.",
					"overall": "Hastened Step could be a level 3 card for many classes and you'd still be happy to take it (it could be a level 7 card for the Music Note class and you'd love it). This card does it all - two great halves and good initiative.<p>You'll pretty much always want to keep this card no matter what you're doing with this class and you'll be happy whichever half you're using - the only bad part is that you can't use both halves each time.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "impalingspear",
					"top": "Now Impaling Spear is an AoE I can get behind. At its worst it's basically an attack 3 range 2 with no adjacency disadvantage that gives 1 XP, which is already quite fine. With our very good amount of move cards, it's not too difficult to line two enemies up for this and get its maximum value of 6 attack. Furthermore, it's much safer than our other AoE as it only needs 2 enemies, not 3, for maximum value, and one of them doesn't even need to be adjacent to us. It also scales better at higher levels for these reasons and because of its higher damage.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, it's complemented by nearly the perfect bottom (come on, this couldn't also be a move 5?), another move 4, for when we need movement, don't have 2 enemies to hit or have a better attack for just a single enemy",
					"overall": "This is a great card than can scale as well.The only downside of this card is the average initiative, which is quite below average for us."
				},
				{
					"id": "ironbulwark",
					"top": "First, the top: attack 3 that gives 1 XP is already decent for level 1, and Muddle is just a small added bonus that does help us to mitigate damage occasionally. Nothing flashy about this half, just a solid workhorse of an above average but not incredible card.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom which compares so favourably to the aforementioned Shield Bash. Not only do we get shield 1, but our allies do as well. Works well with summons and is part of the reason why it's fine to have 2 tanks with this class, because cards like this benefit both tanks significantly.",
					"overall": "Iron Bulwark, another level 1 card that puts the Brute's Shield Bash to shame with its bottom.<p>Early initiative again makes it likely that we can get this buff up before enemies attack.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "oversizedpack",
					"top": "A non-loss loot 2, on top! Wow, that's really great. You can move and still do a loot 2, which until you've experienced a well-positioned loot 2 first-hand (let me assure you, it's glorious), you have no idea just how large loot 2 is. Sadly, we can't regularly use loot cards as they're only good a few times per scenario, at most. The ability to move after the loot does give some additional utility as a top move can be valuable.",
					"bottom": "eanwhile, the bottom is another Quartermaster effect that is unimpressive at level 1 but gets better at higher levels. As we only have 1 consumable item at level 1, this effect is not even remotely worth a loss. By level 7, when you can have 4 consumable items, it starts to get quite tempting, especially with very high Prosperity consumables that have really powerful effects (with high Prosperity I might even consider this effect worth it at level 5). Still, regardless of how good this effect might eventually become at a certain level, the card will always be mediocre at best just because you have no half you can regularly use.",
					"overall": "Oversized Pack is one of those cards with two powerful but unfortunately situational halves stapled together that means the whole is less than the sum of its parts.<p>Having to use a move 2 with 81 initiative for a significant chunk of the scenario just to occasionally get these powerful effects will usually not be worth it.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "proficiency",
					"top": "This top isn't really a situational loss, it's more of a 'play around me' loss that you'll either want to use early in each scenario or not bother bringing it. In order for this effect really to go off for you and thus justify itself, you really want a level 5 card. Until then, I don't think this is worth it. And even then, that level 5 card is also a loss that if you use that combo, only really being worth it on smaller/shorter scenarios (can be great for boss fights). After that, this card also gets better at much higher levels as you get some very large but low damage AoEs, and every +1 attack can make a huge difference on those. Still, at level 1 this is usually best left on the side-lines.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is fine as a move 3, although with poor initiative on a pretty fast class it's still below average. And, unlike other situational loss cards, the fact that you want to use this loss early makes spammable move on the bottom less relevant.",
					"overall": "Proficiency is a card that's kind of unimpressive at level 1 but gets better at higher levels."
				},
				{
					"id": "reservedenergy",
					"top": "The top is a relatively powerful support effect, only let down by the question of 'when exactly do I want to use this?' What I mean is, the most common time we use support cards are when enemies are either all or mostly dead and we're moving from one room to another. But in those situations, you can usually just long rest anyway if you really need to refresh spent items. Otherwise, we use support cards on allies who are in 'deep shit,' but generally healing will be more generically useful for those allies, as well as just attacking to kill enemies that threaten our ally. Thus, while a reasonable effect, especially for a non-loss, you may not find as many situations where this half is actually that useful.",
					"bottom": "Still, it's basically free to have it around because it's tied to a move 4.",
					"overall": "Reserved Energy is exactly how you do situational support cards.<p>The only downside with this move 4 is the bad initiative, but it's still a level 1 move 4, so it'll do.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "restock",
					"top": "The top of Restock is one of those item support cards the Quartermaster has access to. The value of this effect will mostly depend on the size of your group - terrible at 2, mediocre at 3, good at 4. It will also be a bit affected by Prosperity, as again consumable items get much better. Is it worth a loss for a class with 11 cards? Sometimes, although probably not that often depending on scenario length.",
					"bottom": "Fortunately, it doesn't cost much to keep that effect around as we're quite happy to take this card for the bottom only. In general, it's quite a good idea to keep at least one reasonably-sized attack on bottom for those times when you want to make sure to finish off an adjacent enemy. As long as you have enough other good move cards, which the QM does, you can easily get away with it. And while a simple attack 3 is nothing to write home about, as our best level 1 bottom attack it is quite welcome.",
					"overall": "Restock is a decent card, mostly held up by a good bottom for a level 1 card."
				},
				{
					"id": "scrollofrecall",
					"top": "Scroll of Recall top is one of those support effects (admittedly, self-support) that is good between fighting. Moving to the next room? Why don't I get one of my potions back. It's really not bad.",
					"bottom": "The downside for this card though, other than maybe the worst initiative in the game, is that the bottom isn't great at early levels until we can improve our attack modifiers. However, pulling 3 attack modifier cards in a few levels time can be very powerful and something we are happy to do. In the meantime grounding 3 flying enemies can make some scenarios much easier.",
					"overall": "This is another card that is fairly weak to start with, but improves along with our perks when it bocomes quite strong."
				},
				{
					"id": "sharpeningkit",
					"top": "The range on the top can occasionally be limiting, but you've got a lot of movement so it shouldn't be much of a problem. And a heal 4 at level 1 with no requirements is great, with 1 XP to boot.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is another type of support - the best kind. You have a number of ranged attacks so it's very easy to use this bottom without moving, especially at higher levels where you have some giant AoEs making the payoff for this amazing. Otherwise, it will add 1 to your ranged attack, and thanks to good initiative, will be easy to play before your allies to likewise buff them. Remember that effects like this function like 'auras' in other games, which means that your allies have to be in range when they attack to get the buff, regardless of where you were in relation to them when you played this card. That actually works perfectly for you as you're a tank, so you'll be closer to the enemies than your allies most of the time. Thus, your allies can move up near you after you've gone and get the buff.",
					"overall": "Sharpening Kit is another great support card and you'll always be happy to have it."
				},
				{
					"id": "bladedboomerang",
					"top": "Attack 2, Range 3 <i>Wound</i> with 1 XP is almost strictly better than the attack 3 version we have at level 1 (<i>Wound</i> is strictly better than attack 1 about 90% of the time, especially on ranged attacks).",
					"bottom": "So a good attack on top and on bottom a move 4 with upside. The little attack 1 doesn't seem like much, but as your modifier deck improves, you'll be quite happy with it.",
					"overall": "Bladed Boomerang is a great card by virtue of doing a lot of little things that are almost always worthwhile. A little bit of a shame that this card has average initiative, but you can't have it all."
				},
				{
					"id": "reforge",
					"top": "The top of Reforge is obviously much better with consumed weapons than spent ones as they tend to have much more powerful effects which are meant to be held in check by being one-time use only.<p>There are certainly some powerful weapon effects that can absolutely make this worthwhile. Whether it's worth it or not for you will depend on how you/your group wants/needs you to play this class and what weapons you and your allies have access to.</p><p>Still, remember that most of the time, while your party is directly engaged in combat, simply attacking is going to be more effective (and more consistent).</p>",
					"bottom": "The bottom is just fine, a repeatable Minor Stamina Potion. Again, not being directly combat-oriented means you'll usually have better bottoms to use during combat, relegating this mostly to downtime, in which case it will compete with moving in order to get in position for the next room and/or picking up money. For that reason these sort of effects are typically better as a top, which can be used in the aforementioned scenarios in conjunction with movement, but it's still going to be worth it sometimes.",
					"overall": "This is a card that has two decent actions, the problem is that both are situational and neither are of use in combat."
				},
				{
					"id": "continualsuppy",
					"top": "Continual Supply is something Colorado has and now you can too. Unfortunately, once you start passing it around, it won't be for long, as your previously-mentioned card hand limit isn't extremely conducive to loss cards, especially not loss cards that demand additional discards to have an effect. Still, the effect can be EXTREMELY powerful, so if this is everything you've dreamed of doing, go for it.",
					"bottom": "I'm not sure what this bottom is doing on this card - it's basically saying 'yeah, we know you don't have a lot of cards so if you're playing losses you'll appreciate being able to get some cards back.' Unfortunately, it's attached to one of the aforementioned loss cards, and you're not taking this card as a move 2 with 86 initiative just to help with another combo of loss cards eventually.",
					"overall": "If you play the top, which you presumably will almost every scenario at the beginning if you took this card, you'll never see the bottom. So if you're considering this card, it's surely just for the top."
				},
				{
					"id": "scrolloflightning",
					"top": "The top will pretty much remain your consistently best attack for most of your Quartermaster's time adventuring with your party. Attack 5 range 3 at level 3 is just great. It also apparently creates an element, which you don't use but your allies might.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is a move 3 that can sometimes push an enemy into a trap as a bonus, which is nice. And the good news is you'll never even consider using the bottom unless it actually can push someone into a trap because the top is so good. Also, element there too, but you don't use those.",
					"overall": "Scroll of Lightning is just amazing."
				},
				{
					"id": "giantclub",
					"top": "As it turns out, attack 5 on top is still just about as good as it was last level. Sadly, being melee is a bit worse than range 3, but the 1 XP is there to help ease the pain. Sadly, I still usually prefer Scroll of Lightning, but having more attack 5's is never a bad thing.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, we get another attack on bottom, which at attack 3 on a level 4 card isn't great, is still there for free with this top. And adding Muddle does obviously make it slightly better in those cases where we don't kill off an enemy (or can be used to hit a second enemy after we finish the first with our top attack).",
					"overall": "Giant Club is a card which is very subtle about what exactly it does, and it may be difficult to accurately decipher it. Fortunately for you, I'm here to guide you through this."
				},
				{
					"id": "sidepouch",
					"top": "Side Pouch gives a sudden large boost to one ally. The effect is definitely very powerful and can absolutely be worth a loss card. Again, as before, this gets better at higher levels when your allies have more consumable items and at higher Prosperity when you have more powerful items to refresh. The effect is very situational regardless and will usually be held for close to the end of the scenario but that's fine because of such a great spammable bottom.",
					"bottom": "Move 3 loot 1 is just awesome to use. Where'd all that money go? Yeah, that's right, you got it. Adding a loot action on top of a very reasonable move makes it so easy to grab that cash without any added effort, which is normally meant to be the trade-off you have to make to pick up money. Even for the damage-dealing build, Side Pouch is super tempting just for this bottom action (because who doesn't want more money?).",
					"overall": "One thing to watch out for if you're saying 'well, I'm going to go the support build, not the damage build he's suggesting because that's what my party wants/needs' is not to just take all the support cards without thinking about it because they're support cards. There are three reasons for this: first, many of them are loss cards and you'll end up with too many loss cards you want to play without being able to play them all. Second, there's some negative synergy - for example, if you have Continual Supply going, you may get less value out of sharing your Side Pouch with someone. Lastly, if you clog up your hand with a bunch of support cards, you won't be able to consistently actually DO something, and your party may be pretty unhappy with the number of times you can't just help them kill something instead of passing them the Pouch. If you do want to take more support cards than I suggest, make sure it's only as a compliment to damage cards, not instead of."

All of your single-target attacks to be aoe? All of your attacks to be advantaged? Healing? Movement? The list goes on... Oh wait, so what you want is all of those things, just whichever is appropriate at the moment? Yeah, that's what this card does. Take it, build your items around it, use it early and you'll see.",
					"bottom": "And just in case the top of this card alone wasn't enough, there's a tanking/support bottom that puts most other similar effects at level 5 or earlier on other classes to shame with a blazingly-fast initiative to boot.",

					"top": "At level 5 you'll have 18 max hp, so taking 2 damage to deal a small amount of damage to a bunch of enemies can be a trade well worth making. Being 2 direct damage is great too because the problem with small damage attacks is shield, and a bunch of enemies that have low hp pools tend to have high shield values. The biggest problem is that it is just 2 damage, meaning you'll probably kill almost nothing, just soften up a bunch of things. Still, with many rooms in which this can easily deal out 20 damage or more, you'll find the numbers well worth it (especially at larger party numbers).",
					"bottom": "And to compliment this very powerful but situational card you've got an amazing spammable bottom. Move 3 is fine and adding a non-loss stun is almost too good to be true. Much like Crushing Hammer did at level 1, this allows you to manoeuvre around rooms where you're already engaged with enemies, stun an enemy to negate a significant amount of damage and then still get to use a top attack. So yeah, Scroll of Judgment is a good card. Unfortunately for it, it comes at the same level as Reinforced Steel.",

Anyway, you should pretty much only use this with Sharpening Kit, try to get a Power Potion at the least, etc. And if the scenario includes a significant number of enemies with at least Shield 1, maybe leave this card on the side-lines.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom isn't useful for most of the scenario but typically is extremely powerful at the end (so powerful that it was nerfed in the second edition). You'll only use it once per scenario, if you use it at all, but when you do, you'll be happy to have it.",

That sort of effect was pretty decent for the Tinkerer because he has 12 cards and most of his actions suck. We have just 9 cards and amazing actions, if anything, someone should do this for us, not the other way around.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, as much as I like free crowd-control on bottom move actions, letting the enemies get next to you first in order for it to work just isn't that way to do that. Sure, this will sometimes work, but not often enough to be worth an otherwise pretty miserable action and nothing we want to see on top.",

Loss heal actions on a class with 9 cards and some incredibly powerful other actions and loss actions are just not even worth considering.

It might seem like this is what's needed to make Catastrophic Bomb fine even on scenarios with lots of Shielded enemies, but that means we don't get Sharpening Kit, and unfortunately that just doesn't work.

But more importantly, you really can't beat that bottom effect.</li><li>The top and bottom are both situational. You typically won't want to use the bottom before the last half or third of the scenario, which means you'll only be able to use it as a move 2 or a Loot 3. Sure, Loot 3 is good, but you still can't (or shouldn't!) use it in combat, and with only a 9 card hand size, you will end up needing to play this at some point in combat.</li><li>I can't predict your Prosperity. If you're Prosperity 9, this bottom action is a lot better than if you're Prosperity 3.</li></ol></p>"

But then spammable non-loss AOE crowd-control. I mean, come on... What else can you ask for?",
					"bottom": "This bottom action is honestly broken. Just play with it a bit and you'll see. One of the cards that has the single most noticeable impact on scenario difficulty in the game.

Yeah, that's called 'winning.'",

Taking this into account along with the facvt that the archid mod also m,akes changes ot the class and cards this build is very much a custom one.",
          "In order for the recovery to work we need to take 2 specific cards, one for items and one for cards along with Stamina potions and some perks. That is quite a set of requirements and the build is not fully hooked up until higher levels, but it is still very viable from the start. The build uses ranegd attacks for its damage so the card choices come from the ranged striker build where they do not conflict with our goal.",

          "top": "The top is one of your two level 1 AoEs and has its positives and negatives. The positive is that it has an upside of 6 damage, which is a ton for level 1. Otherwise, even just hitting 2 enemies for 2 each and gaining 1 XP is quite good for a level 1 card. On the other hand, however, there are some problems with this type of large area low damage melee AoE. First of all, in order to maximize the value of this attack, you need to get next to 2-3 enemies. Even the tank build doen't want to actively search out enemies to hit you. And because the damage of this AoE is so low, you're unlikely to actually kill them unless they're already quite weak, meaning they will need to be dealt with or they will all hit you for more damage than this attack is worth. The good news is that you have a number of early initiative cards, so you can very realistically go before your allies and then rely on them to finish off most of the enemies you hit with this, so you don't get messed up when the monsters go. This still also requires your allies to go early in the round and this sort of move can get very heavily punished by a couple of bad attack modifier draws by your and/or your allies. Thus, there's a lot that has to be done in order to make this work. Secondly, because of the low damage on this attack, it scales very poorly as monster level increases, also because the monsters will hit for more damage if you don't kill them, making it even more punishing and less likely to be worth it. Fortunately, at higher levels, modifier decks tend to be more reliable so you should have an accurate enough assessment of whether you can make it work or not.",

Again, if you've played the Brute before this you know how often you used his ranged attack. Ranged attacks are just really good in this game because range can effectively function like healing against a lot of enemies by keeping you out of range of their attacks.",
          "bottom": "The bottom is another attack on bottom which we'll use as crowd control to prevent an enemy from getting in range to attack. Immobilize is unfortunately not great against a number of the more threatening enemies in the game, but it certainly has its uses. And by being a situational bottom attached to a top we're always happy to use, we pay nothing for the pleasure.",
          "overall": "Crippling Bow is another above average card. The ability to force flying enemies to move around objects and be subject to traps adds real value to this card in some scenarios.<p>Sadly, especially for a card with crowd control, it does suffer from middling initiative.</p>"

In reality, the top more likely reads 'gain 2 experience at the end of the scenario.'",
          "bottom": "And the bottom really is great for a level 1 card. Move 2 isn't a ton, and it does hurt a bit that you can't actually enhance the move to increase it by 1 (actually a common trend for the Quartermaster and probably his biggest downside - he has very few cards that can be meaningfully enhanced, probably because his cards are already so good), but adding a free shield 1 self on makes a world of difference. In reality, you can more look at this like the move 2 is tacked on to a shield 1. For example, the Brute has a level 1 card that is JUST shield 1 self with 15 initiative. Here you have move 2 shield 1 self at 17 initiative, and obviously that's just night and day better. The added 2 move allows you to move from one enemy to another when you're already in a room fighting a group of enemies, while also mitigating damage you'd take by being in the thick of things. And of course having such great initiative on the card makes it so you'll almost always get the shield up before enemies can go.",

That could indicate that tanking isn't necessarily something core for the Quartermaster, compared to the Brute, but the QM actually has a better tanking perk than the Brute does. Anyway, just an interesting thought, but I do consider this card to be incredibly core for this class.</p>"

Eventually, as your modifier deck improves, this will get to be significantly better than attack 4. And of course throwing the move 1 in between the two attacks, rather than at the end, gives a lot more flexibility most of the time.",

With our very good amount of move cards, it's not too difficult to line two enemies up for this and get its maximum value of 6 attack. Furthermore, it's much safer than our other AoE as it only needs 2 enemies, not 3, for maximum value, and one of them doesn't even need to be adjacent to us. It also scales better at higher levels for these reasons and because of its higher damage.",

Still, regardless of how good this effect might eventually become at a certain level, the card will always be mediocre at best just because you have no half you can regularly use.",

And even then, that level 5 card is also a loss that if you use that combo, only really being worth it on smaller/shorter scenarios (can be great for boss fights). After that, this card also gets better at much higher levels as you get some very large but low damage AoEs, and every +1 attack can make a huge difference on those. Still, at level 1 this is usually best left on the side-lines.",

Otherwise, we use support cards on allies who are in 'deep shit,' but generally healing will be more generically useful for those allies, as well as just attacking to kill enemies that threaten our ally. Thus, while a reasonable effect, especially for a non-loss, you may not find as many situations where this half is actually that useful.",

Sometimes, although probably not that often depending on scenario length.",

In general, it's quite a good idea to keep at least one reasonably-sized attack on bottom for those times when you want to make sure to finish off an adjacent enemy.

Remember that effects like this function like 'auras' in other games, which means that your allies have to be in range when they attack to get the buff, regardless of where you were in relation to them when you played this card.

There are three reasons for this: first, many of them are loss cards and you'll end up with too many loss cards you want to play without being able to play them all. Second, there's some negative synergy - for example, if you have Continual Supply going, you may get less value out of sharing your Side Pouch with someone. Lastly, if you clog up your hand with a bunch of support cards, you won't be able to consistently actually DO something, and your party may be pretty unhappy with the number of times you can't just help them kill something instead of passing them the Pouch. If you do want to take more support cards than I suggest, make sure it's only as a compliment to damage cards, not instead of."

The biggest problem is that it is just 2 damage, meaning you'll probably kill almost nothing, just soften up a bunch of things.

					  "Hello everyone! I've now played the Music Note to retirement (or almost retirement, in the case of my current play-through) three times and feel pretty confident with a class that was initially difficult for me to assess. In both of my last two play-throughs, both to level 9, I've used this same build and I think it's very effective.",
						"That being said, there are some stipulations for this guide:<ul><li>This guide is designed for playing this class in a three or four-player party. I do not recommend using this build if you're playing two-player.</li><li>This build absolutely requires access to a Prosperity 4 item and therefore is not recommended for anyone below Prosperity 4 as you'll just be completely lacking something if you use the same cards and try to play the same way.</li></ul>",
						"<p>The Soothsinger is the most successful class in the game, from a design perspective, in terms of creating a pure support that also feels powerful. Instead of focusing on aspects of support that scale very poorly in Gloomhaven, like healing, the Soothsinger spends her actions making sure that enemies deal no damage, which, as it turns out, is a pretty powerful thing to bring to a party. The biggest weakness this class has is its party-size scaling. While incredibly powerful in a 4p party and still quite a force in a 3p party, a lot of her actions are less impressive with only one ally and a lot less enemies in 2p. Accordingly, if you are trying to play a Soothsinger in a 2p party, I wouldn't recommend following this guide, which is designed around playing mostly pure support in a three or four player party. Fortunately, we already have a guide that lays out how to play the class as a damage-dealer in a 2p party in the Class Resources section of the subreddit. Be warned, that build does largely depend on already having a significantly-improved modifier deck and Prosperity 5.</p>",
						"<p>Secondly, this guide/build relies heavily on access to Item 29, The Comfortable Shoes, which comes with Prosperity 4. If you don't have access to that item, similarly I would not recommend this guide, as this build will simply not function effectively without that item. The Comfortable Shoes are the cornerstone of this Soothsinger build. Why? Well, the Soothsinger has significantly more good bottom actions than good top actions. Most of the cards you'll want to bring to most scenarios will be almost exclusively for bottom actions. On top of that, you have a few staple top actions you'll need, and then 1-3 Songs as well. When you add needing movement cards onto that, it's very taxing on your 9-card hand size. Accordingly, we forego movement actions entirely and just get to bring a ton of good bottom actions, allowing us more flexibility to have the best bottom action for each situation without being handicapped by a lack of movement.</p>",
						"<p>That being said, you should always do your best to anticipate the needs of each scenario - if it's clear the scenario will require a lot of movement, you can always consider slotting in at least one Move 4 from your level 1 cards. Additionally, I wholeheartedly recommend getting your solo scenario item ASAP, as it's great for this class in general, but will also completely relieve any movement issues when combined with these boots.</p>",
						"<p>Finally, I normally don't pay much mind to experience unless the class really has issues with it or specific reasons to need a bunch of it (like a pre-4 Cragheart) but in this guide I will 100% be ignoring it. This class has, by far, the best XP gain in the game and without even trying you'll be swimming in more XP than you know what to do with.</p>"

						"An important tip top note with Songs: always pay attention when you rest to whether you should bring the Song back or not. If bringing the Song back will result in an even hand size after the obligatory loss, you'll be netting a turn of longevity, which is very welcome on this low-longevity class. Additionally, as you lack top actions, many times you don't even mind spending your top action for the turn (re)playing a Song, doubly-so if you have your solo item. Obviously if you're in the middle of some really intense combat, you're usually better off not bringing the Song back so that you can immediately play a top CC action, so you do need to read the situation."

It has a few things going for its top. First of all, we're very bottom-heavy, as already described, thus a top action that does *something*, regardless of where we are relative to our allies, is nice (as we spend many turns not wanting to move). It also has one of our two late initiatives, which is welcome, although both the top action and the initiative aren't as good as Singing Arrow, but it's still a perfectly acceptable second fiddle.</p><p>We're happy to have the card for a bit just for the top, and the bottom is pure bonus.</p>"

Bosses are the most obvious, but also scenarios with more enemies like Night Demons or Stone Golems, who come in small numbers and hit very hard. In those cases, this will block less damage as there will be less enemy attacks, and you'll want more damage (a la Power Ballad) to break through their thick hides.<p>Defensive Ditty also has great initiative, allowing you to play your bottom action safely the first turn of the scenario when you get this Song up or guaranteeing (most of the time) that the bottom goes before the enemy you want to block.</p>"

We're squishy and have a tiny hand size so getting into melee can be risky but there are still many opportunities in most scenarios where we can get away with it and we have a broken modifier deck so we're happy for any opportunity we get to attack.

Unfortunately, as we won't have Boots of Striding, it can be hard to get too much value off of this without our allies playing around it, but honestly you can be more than happy even if you just hit one ally on average with this bottom action, at least at early levels.",
					"overall": "Sometimes you just need damage more than survivability. While our survivability Songs are certainly more effective overall, in some situations you'll happily trade generic effectiveness for relative effectiveness. A good example would be on boss fights, where blocking 1 damage per turn from an Attack 8 is pretty meaningless, but 3 extra damage towards the boss per turn is quite helpful.<p>Finally, at level 1 at least, 19 initiative isn't bad for us in terms of going fast (although we'll quickly outpace that).</p>"

Sure, your Songs have an enormous impact on each scenario but you could replace Ditty with Ballad or Song of Speed and you'd still be adding a lot, even if it's not quite as good.<p>Short rest advice: DO NOT LOSE THIS CARD TO A SHORT REST BEFORE LEVEL 6. As far as you're concerned, you're a Spellweaver and this is Reviving Ether (again, pre-6). Even Disorienting Dirge, the best level 4 card in the game, is safer to lose than this. If you hit this on a short rest, reroll every time (pre-6). If you hit something else, consider the number of cards in your hand and the value of that card vs the risk of losing this one.

A top loss on a class with 9 cards that also sometimes leaves persistent cards up and loses longevity accordingly would need to be really powerful.<p>The biggest problem, however, is just one of initiative. Shield is only good if you go before enemies and this card, inexplicably, has horrible initiative. On top of that, you simply don't have non-Song top actions with good initiative; you won't play Songs many times in a scenario so you can't count on them for initiative and your bottom actions with good initiative aren't going to help you play this card any more effectively. The best use would be the first turn of a scenario, combined with Defensive Ditty for initiative, but that's still pretty narrow for this card unless you can guarantee a long rest afterwards and on top of that, first rooms will typically put you in a spot where you don't need to move, in which case you have a ton of better bottom actions.</p>"

The biggest advantage this has over Power Ballad as an offensive song is that it does work with AOE attacks so it's possible this might work in some parties that are something like Soothsinger + rarely-attacking tank + low-damage, multiple non-loss large AOE attacks ranged class such as the Quartermaster with their level 6 card.</p>"

That clearly means it's better than whatever the other level 4 card is from the same class. So why is Dirge so good? Well, as alluded-to before, it's a one-card combo.<p>You ignore the top Song for a while in each scenario and just play the insane bottom. Each bottom action should yield around 3-5 Curses, on average (sometimes more), and 2-3 Blesses, depending on your party size. Then, after about 2 rest cycles (or less, with Stamina Potions) of playing this bottom action, combined with the top of Singing Arrow, you easily reach 8+ Curses in the monster deck, and switch out your Song for this one. Now you're negating ~60% of enemy attacks, which just makes most fighting trivial. You burn through those Curses pretty quickly, and you're back to the bottom, then back to the top, then back to the bottom, then back to the top. Now you're on a boat. You get the idea.</p>"

					"overall": "The bottom does still have some application on really short boss fight scenarios or other, similar scenarios which you expect will last 10 rounds or less.

Disarming Voice was insane at level 1, Provoke Terror is still insane at level 6.<p>There are only two downsides to Provoke Terror: how easy scenarios just became and that it costs a lot more to enhance than Voice. Your top/bottom action ratio is also mostly solved now as you'll commonly use both Voice and Terror top over the course of two turns then Stamina Potion then both back and get to play them for two more turns with more of your great bottom actions.

					"bottom": "The bottom of Pull the Strings is also very cool and very powerful and makes up for the top being more situational by being much more broadly-applicable. Not great in scenarios with a bunch of small, weak enemies, but in scenarios with some hard-hitters this can be some devastating damage from a bottom action. The worst part (other than being at level 6 against Provoke Terror) is that it doesn't use your beautiful modifier deck (it also adds another good bottom action, which does become a bit of an issue for us, especially with what we'll want to take at level 7).",

I will mention, however, that as Lullaby scales poorly, if you're starting at maybe level 6+ and certainly level 7+, you should just take Change Tempo instead, as it will function well as a sideboard card, Lullaby is pretty mediocre by those levels, and you can get Trill at 8 to fill the healing gap left by not having Lullaby as an option.<p>Soothing Lullaby replaces Song of Speed, one good initiative for another, even if it's not as good as Song's, it does come with a much better bottom action.</p>"

Now with Provoke, it's less of a necessity. On the first rest cycle we have four tops: Song, Provoke, Voice, and Arrow. Then afterwards we'll normally bring the Song back for another turn of longevity so we repeat the same cycle at 8 cards; if we're in tough combat we won't but then we'll just have 7 cards and only need 3 tops (Provoke, Voice, and Arrow). You can further smooth the top/bottom imbalance with Stamina Potions, as already mentioned, if you run into problems because of losing cards on rests.</p>"

Healing just doesn't scale that well, although the top was still nice to deal with Poison and Wound, and was most commonly just used as a Move 3 with 11 initiative by this point, which was also alright. If your party desperately needs healing, you've likely taken Trill at level 8 anyway.<p>Echoing Aria is another candidate depending on your party composition and how often you find yourself using the bottom shield.</p><p>If you took Trill or Strings at level 8 and already replaced Soothing Lullaby, you should replace Singing Arrow here at 9. If you took Trill or Strings at 8 and you replace Singing Arrow now, you'll find yourself with only two good top actions per rest cycle. If you have your solo item, that will help a lot. Additionally, you should be very careful about losing either top action on rests and certainly abuse getting both of them back together with Stamina Potions.</p>"

					  "The Soothsinger is, in my opinion, the most versatile class in the game. No matter your party composition, no matter the scenario or situation, no matter the stage of character development or difficulty of the game/campaign, she is always going to have many options available to her to make a big impact. This makes her a blast to play. Playing her, you'll never feel like you're weak, or not useful in a specific party or scenario. Also, all your party members will love having you around because of what you bring to the party.",
						"<p>Before I start, let me set the stage:<ol><li>This guide is for playing Soothsinger as what is broadly called a 'support' character. I'm going to assume you have at least one other primary damage dealer in you party and that you aren't expected to contribute directly to attacking. That's the only thing you'll need -- a tank is neither needed nor assumed.</li><li>I play the Soothsinger in 3-4 character parties. In a 2 character party, you may need to have slightly more offensive focus if your partner is a medium damage dealer only.</li><li>This guide is written with the 'late-game' in mind (high character level, high scenario difficulty level). The Soothsinger is a very powerful and versatile classes at all stages of the game, and you can get away with doing almost anything you want. As a result, it is only as the game gets much harder that you need a more focussed strategy, and this is what this guide is for.</li></ol></p>",
						"<p>When I refer to 'late-game' in this guide, this refers loosely to situations where monsters begin to become very strong, and start to make modest numbers like Attack 3 or Shield 1-2 look relatively insignificant. This generally comes as you approach character level 9, but can come earlier if you start to bump the scenario difficulty higher than the recommended level.</p>",
						"<p>I've played a lot of the Soothsinger to great effect at scenario difficulty 6-7, so those are my credentials.</p>",
						"<p>An important tip top note with Songs: always pay attention when you rest to whether you should bring the Song back or not. If bringing the Song back will result in an even hand size, you'll be netting a turn of longevity, which is very welcome on this low-longevity class. Additionally, as you lack top actions, many times you don't even mind spending your top action for the turn (re)playing a Song, doubly-so if you have your solo item. Obviously if you're in the middle of some really intense combat, you're usually better off not bringing the Song back so that you can immediately play a top CC action, so you do need to read the situation.</p>"

					"headingtext": "Supporting and Negating",
					"content": [
					  "From here on out, I'm going to split up the broad idea of 'support' into two. The Soothsinger excels at two things:<ol><li>'Support' abilities: supporting allies directly in terms of defence, offence and utility, usually by providing passive song bonuses or active bonuses.</li><li>'Negation' abilities: negating monster effectiveness, mainly through: (i) crowd control abilities (stun/disarm); and (ii) curses.</li></ol>",
						"<p>Both supporting and negating are useful, and what's great is that the Soothsinger has so many types of each in her arsenal. For the most part, you can focus on whichever you find more interesting and you'll get by.</p>"
					]
				},
			  {
					"headinglevel": 3,
					"headingtext": "Changing with Monster Levels",
					"content": [
					  "As you start to approach late-game, the equation starts to change. Almost all of the Soothsinger's supporting abilities are numerically based, meaning they have set numerical values.",
					  "<p>Examples:<ul><li>In defence: her shield song (Defensive Ditty [1]) gives Shield 1 to all allies, and this isn't going ever to improve.</li><li>In offence: she can make an ally perform an Attack 4 (Call to Action [1]), and this particular card isn't getting any stronger. Or her +1 attack song (Power Ballad [1]) will give, of course, +1 attack, and no more.</li></ul></p>",
					  "<p>This makes her supporting abilities weaker as enemies get stronger. That Shield 1 is great when enemies are hitting you with Attack 2 or 3, by mitigating 33-50% of damage on average. When the enemies are hitting you with Attack 5 or 6, that Shield 1 is starting to look less useful, mitigating only 16.6-20% of damage on average. It's still better than nothing, of course, but there's the opportunity cost of not playing a better card instead</p>",
					  "<p>In contrast, negating abilities scale completely with the strength of monsters. A stun or disarm, stops a monster from attacking at all. It mitigates 100% of any given attack, no matter how big. The same is true for curses. As a result, the Soothsinger's negating abilities are what makes her really shine in the late-game. At the same time, it is just as effective at early to mid-game, so you lose nothing by investing in the late-game and focusing on negation.</p>"
					]
				},
			  {
					"headinglevel": 2,
					"headingtext": "Build Philosophy",
					"content": [
					  "<ol><li>As explained above, we prioritise negating ability cards over supporting ability cards.</li><li>Pick one or two songs which suit your party/scenario, and stick to them. In 90% of situations, I use the same song for a whole scenario (picking it up when resting if needed to get an even-numbered card hand, in order to maximise the number of turns, of course). There is no need to bring extra song cards, 'just in case' the song is useful. As a result, you're able to bring some cards with powerful active (non-song) top-side actions. This means that switching songs often is a big opportunity cost, since you give up a powerful active top-side action, so this provides more reason to stick with one song. Think of the song as a nice constant passive bonus, but no more -- the active negating abilities are your most important actions.</li><li>Many of the Soothsinger's most powerful active actions are bottom-side actions. This means you don't get to move often. But when you do move, make it count, so that you're in the best position to do a powerful bottom-side action the next turn or two. This means we need to have a couple big move cards in our deck. I will refer to these two cards as your two 'primary' move cards. This may be supplemented by slightly smaller 'secondary' move cards.</li><li>The Soothsinger has a small hand size of 9, and has so many immensely powerful non-loss cards (some are more powerful than the loss actions of many other classes). As a result, we want to maximise the longevity of her ability to play these cards repeatedly. For the Soothsinger, no action is worth losing a card over, unless it's for a critical moment in very situation-specific situations, so we aren't going to pick a card just for its loss action.</li></ol>",
						"<p>In summary, we are going to pick our cards when we level up with the above things in mind. This means that: (i) we will choose negating cards over non-scaling supporting cards; (ii) skip songs which will get replaced later on, or which are outclassed by a non-song card that level, and prefer songs that aren't very situationally dependent; (iii) give high priority to big move cards; (iv) generally ignore the lose actions on cards.</p>"

In those cases, this will block less damage as there will be less enemy attacks, and you'll want more damage (a la Power Ballad) to break through their thick hides.<p>Defensive Ditty also has great initiative, allowing you to play your bottom action safely the first turn of the scenario when you get this Song up or guaranteeing (most of the time) that the bottom goes before the enemy you want to block.</p>"

Unfortunately, as we won't have Boots of Striding, it can be hard to get too much value off of this without our allies playing around it, but honestly you can be more than happy even if you just hit one ally on average with this bottom action, at least at early levels.",

While our survivability Songs are certainly more effective overall, in some situations you'll happily trade generic effectiveness for relative effectiveness.

As far as you're concerned, you're a Spellweaver and this is Reviving Ether (again, pre-6). Even Disorienting Dirge, the best level 4 card in the game, is safer to lose than this. If you hit this on a short rest, reroll every time (pre-6). If you hit something else, consider the number of cards in your hand and the value of that card vs the risk of losing this one.

A top loss on a class with 9 cards that also sometimes leaves persistent cards up and loses longevity accordingly would need to be really powerful.<p>The biggest problem, however, is just one of initiative. Shield is only good if you go before enemies and this card, inexplicably, has horrible initiative. On top of that, you simply don't have non-Song top actions with good initiative; you won't play Songs many times in a scenario so you can't count on them for initiative and your bottom actions with good initiative aren't going to help you play this card any more effectively. The best use would be the first turn of a scenario, combined with Defensive Ditty for initiative, but that's still pretty narrow for this card unless you can guarantee a long rest afterwards and on top of that, first rooms will typically put you in a spot where you don't need to move, in which case you have a ton of better bottom actions.</p>"

					"overall": "Wistful Wounding is our worst Song yet although the bar was quite high with two that were very good generically and one that was excellent situationally.<p>The idea is just to switch this on for 1-2 turns and attack a bunch of different targets but first of all, that's highly situational for a card that also has a pretty situational bottom and that actively encourages bad targeting (it's typically much better to focus-fire enemies to eliminate incoming damage as quickly as possible). The biggest advantage this has over Power Ballad as an offensive song is that it does work with AOE attacks so it's possible this might work in some parties that are something like Soothsinger + rarely-attacking tank + low-damage, multiple non-loss large AOE attacks ranged class such as the Quartermaster with their level 6 card.</p>"

The biggest argument against this card is that, at least at levels 3-6, Echoing Aria's bottom with Ditty as a Song will basically do 80-90% of what the top loss on Chorus would do anyway, only without costing a loss. Then having Aria also helps our initiative enormously as well.</p>"

It is specifically very good against Flame Demons and still decent against some other, similar enemies but by having to put Ditty away and not getting the bottom of Aria at the same time, you will be taking some significant damage to deal damage to them. Still, many times you'll be happy to have ANY method of taking down Flame Demons, even if it's messy.",

That clearly means it's better than whatever the other level 4 card is from the same class. So why is Dirge so good? Well, as alluded-to before, it's a one-card combo.<p>You ignore the top Song for a while in each scenario and just play the insane bottom. Each bottom action should yield around 3-5 Curses, on average (sometimes more), and 2-3 Blesses, depending on your party size. Then, after about 2 rest cycles (or less, with Stamina Potions) of playing this bottom action, combined with the top of Singing Arrow, you easily reach 8+ Curses in the monster deck, and switch out your Song for this one. Now you're negating ~60% of enemy attacks, which just makes most fighting trivial. You burn through those Curses pretty quickly, and you're back to the bottom, then back to the top, then back to the bottom, then back to the top. Now you're on a boat. You get the idea.</p>"

Call to Action had much better initiative and a pretty much non-situational top. Here you've got two situational halves in exchange for 1 better Attack on bottom with removed range restrictions. Meh.

					"overall": "The bottom does still have some application on really short boss fight scenarios or other, similar scenarios which you expect will last 10 rounds or less.

We already have an 8, a 9, and an 11, so the initiative isn't that important for us, and if we use Comfy Shoes we're less obligated to take big move actions like this one.",

Disarming Voice was insane at level 1, Provoke Terror is still insane at level 6.<p>There are only two downsides to Provoke Terror: how easy scenarios just became and that it costs a lot more to enhance than Voice. Your top/bottom action ratio is also mostly solved now as you'll commonly use both Voice and Terror top over the course of two turns then Stamina Potion then both back and get to play them for two more turns with more of your great bottom actions.

Thus, the top is more appropriate if you plan on cycling Songs more often rather than firing-and-forgetting.",
					"bottom": "The bottom of Pull the Strings is also very cool and very powerful and makes up for the top being more situational by being much more broadly-applicable. Not great in scenarios with a bunch of small, weak enemies, but in scenarios with some hard-hitters this can be some devastating damage from a bottom action. The worst part (other than being at level 6 against Provoke Terror) is that it doesn't use your beautiful modifier deck (it also adds another good bottom action, which does become a bit of an issue for us, especially with what we'll want to take at level 7).",

					  "The Tinkerer is the support class of the starting 6. The Cragheart can also be somewhat of a support but the Tinkerer is the one true support option you start with. She has great healing and a medium-sized health pool. What she lacks, mostly, is damage. She has a number of attacks, some of which are quite decent, although many times they're good because of status effects rather than the damage they deal (further solidifying her role as a support). Her few really good damage attacks are all losses and unlike the Spellweaver, she can't reuse them. Unlike any other of the starting classes, however, she has a hand size of 12, which is enormous and both gives her a ton of longevity as well as the flexibility to use more loss cards than most other classes. She typically plays from ranged, as she has little benefit from getting into melee range, but a reasonable health pool and a huge hand size means she can risk getting up close and taking a few hits if absolutely necessary.",
						"<p>There are really two paths to take with the Tinkerer when you level her up: focusing on healing or focusing on damage-dealing. This guide will be for the damage build that is better for 3p group as the group may still need some support and the Tinkerer will bring just the right amount by focusing on the damage build. With the healing build, you may find yourself lacking damage when your group needs it more than healing.</p>"

So we'll like to stick right at 3-4 losses we really want to use and not more. If we keep too many cards because they have losses we want to use, we'll have all these options but not be able to use them all, making them all worse.<p>I should mention that there is commonly an exception to this: boss fights. Most boss fight scenarios are sprints rather than marathons and you can consider bringing more losses if you're doing a small-map boss fight scenario.</p>"

					  "Welcome to my guide to the Nightshroud, my personal favourite character and arguably the most powerful in the game (other leading contenders being specific builds of the Sun and Music Note). Properly designed, playing this character is the Gloomhaven equivalent of God-mode, as you can basically ignore all monster attacks, damage, statuses, hit points, shields, and...pretty much everything else that creates challenges for your mortal companions.",
						"<p>On a related note, and as a preface to the strategy discussion, it's worth briefly discussing some metagame considerations for this character. In addition to being enormously powerful, the Nightshroud is mostly a loner, which tends to reduce the amount of teamwork and coordination required with your companions. Support characters, in particular, may end up feeling a bit left out of the action when you need no healing, use no buffs, are indifferent to monster statuses, and (for the most part) hit points. In addition, your invulnerability stems from your ability to near-constantly remain invisible, which will ensure that whichever monsters you haven't yet killed will concentrate fire on your companions. Properly played, this won't necessarily make you a 'bad' teammate, as you will be shielding them (as an obstacle) and dropping bodies with great effectiveness; however, there's some risk your teammates will end up feeling less than thrilled in the end. I've played this class for ~10 scenarios now, and consider myself fortunate that my friends were very good sports about the whole thing.</p>"

						"<ol><li><b>Inflexibility</b>: accomplishing all of the aforementioned lofty goals comes at a cost: one must plan carefully in advance more than any other class, such that every single card played, in the correct order, is a cog in a complex machine. (Ironically, this will result in some of our actions being quite underwhelming in the short-term, as they are intended primarily as setup for a later nova action.) Death incarnate needs to keep to a strict schedule.</li><li><b>Card count / Loss actions</b>: With a hand of only 9 cards, each one is precious and playing cards as losses will risk early exhaustion. Also, losing cards prematurely is tantamount to needlessly removing cogs from the previously-mentioned complex machine, which can cause serious problems.</li><li><b>Movement</b>: This one will get a lot better as we level up, buy enhancements, and acquire equipment, but out of the gate at level 1 this character is possibly the slowest in the game.</li><li><b>Resting</b>: Related to the first point, the Nightshroud can almost never afford to short rest, as removing a cog from the machine at random is extremely risky. During a long-rest will, incidentally, be one of the few times you are at risk of being hit, unless you get help from an item or ally to turn invisible again.</li><li><b>Traps</b>: For the first several levels, this class has no access to jump movements or push/pull attacks, and can't afford to waste money or body/enhancement slots on a jump item or enhancement. That said, we have a surprisingly large health pool (medium progression) and almost never get hit, so I quickly became our party's resident expert at disarming traps for the group (using my face). For the Nightshroud, hit points (friend and foe) are just a state of mind.</li></ol>"

						"<p>This is a summary of what we are aspiring to accomplish, for each action of the game. Note that this is idealized, and much of it will only become possible at higher levels and/or through the use of items and/or help from teammates (the turn 3 bottom, in particular, will never work perfectly without items and/or help).</p>",
						"<p>As a first rules reminder, invisibility expires at the END of your turn after turning invisible, so you can still use it on the second turn after you turn invisible.</p>",
						"<p>Corollary to that, manipulation of initiative is critical to maximize your invisibility, and is therefore key to maximizing your effectiveness. Often, people think of 'good' and 'bad' initiative as synonymous with 'early' and 'late', which is far from the case (for all classes). In almost all situations, you have a preference for whether you want to go before or after the monsters, and choosing your initiative is your way of forcing the monsters to play in your desired order. Therefore, 'good' initiative means a mix of extremes to enable the player to choose to act first or last, with 'bad' initiative cards residing in the middle (playing initiative 50 is effectively ceding control of the order to a coin toss). Fortunately, the Nightshroud happens to be among the best in the game in that area, with some cards that are very early and others that are very late; monsters causing you problems by acting out of order will be a rare occurrence indeed. In particular, this will enable you to consistently turn invisible before the monsters act in a round, and not reappear until after they have already wasted their following turn.</p>",
						"<p>As a second rules reminder, you cannot consume an element that you generated in the same turn, but you CAN consume an element while simultaneously generating it for the following turn. The Nightshroud will very often consume and generate Dark on the same turn.</p>"

Your tactics from there will be dictated by the types of monsters in the room, but in all cases depend upon you and your teammate(s) aggressively manipulating initiative:",

If your teammates do it properly, the monsters will move right up next to you in order to get as close as they can to within range of your teammates, at which point you will murder them (the monsters, that is).</li><li><b>Flying monsters</b>: These end up behaving similarly to ranged enemies, but mostly bypass your door-jamming.

When they land near you, kill them.</li><li><bv>Melee monsters</b>: This is where your shielding will really shine, as your party can just ignore them altogether until you've finished killing the monsters in the other 2 categories. If you want to really err on the safe side, you can manipulate initiative to move in the same way as your teammates, and go 'hunting' every second turn before returning to your post on the door (IE, start on the door, act late and move off, kill a monster, act early, attack another monster and then move back to the door).</li></ol>"

Technically you could just pick a random non-Dark element on Prepare for the Kill for 200 gold, but the extra flexibility is really worth it to either support a teammate with an element they want (before you reach level 6), or stay out of their way (if they are generating and consuming Light, for example, you can end up double generating before anyone consumes it, such that one of you is stuck with none).</p>",

When I played this class, I had help from an ally with a class ability to both turn me invisible and generate Dark (it was SO helpful), but without that huge luxury you are probably better off instead using Black Arrow to turn yourself invisible, and then relying on an item or ally to generate Dark for you. This will, however, leave you without movement for that turn, so you'll need to be careful to pre-position yourself at the end of the prior turn in a place where you can kill another monster.<p>For a while now I've made reference to potentially getting help from an ally or item for generating Dark, but level 6 is where the pressure to find such a solution really reaches an inflection point. If at all possible, you actually want to avoid using one of your hand-slots on a Dark generating item (though it's worth it to do so if you have no other option), so now is the time to beg, plead and/or bribe your friends to invest in some Dark generation on your behalf.</p><p>As you try to get your friends to generate Dark for you, there is one notable factor that should help make it easier: due to your manipulation of initiative (which you will likely be doing more effectively even if they are doing it as well), they will likely take 2 turns between your turn 3 (early) and turn 4 (late), meaning that they have 2 chances to generate Dark for you. Also, if played properly, you'll only need help in the Dark department once per cycle.</p>",

					"comment": "Before I cover the last (awful) batch of perks, we need to take a step back to think about how our attacks differ from most. Unlike a typical DPS or AOE class that wants to make the most out of a larger number of 3-4 attacks, we only make one real attack per cycle, with Silent Force (technically yes we also get a puny attack 1-2 with Wings of the Night or Grim Sustenance, and sometimes with Doomed Breeze, but those are so pathetic that designing our deck around them is the tail wagging the dog). [Refer also to the Prosperity 3 item spoiler section for another point that further reinforces this situation]. The effective value of the 'Null' and '2x' cards in most decks is thus 3-4, by either negating or doubling the attack 3-4. For us, however, this is not the case. The 'Null' is worth a whopping -8 (or the remaining hp of the monster, if lower), and the 2x is usually more like +0-2 if the monster would be dead anyway (or narrowly survive with 1-2 hp). In rare cases, like a boss fight, the 2x will give us full credit for an awesome +8, but those situations are rare (again, for the big 16 hp monster, we are just executing anyway, so there is a selection bias in our attacks). This is a long way of highlighting a simple fact: for this class, pulling the 'Null' card is a total disaster, so we need to be careful about taking perks that thin out our deck, thereby increasing the risk of pulling the 'Null'. In fact, in certain scenarios with a large number of ~6 hp enemies (or those with 6 hp enemies surrounding 1-2 big bads that you'll outright execute), which will die even by pulling the -1 or -2 cards, we would prefer to add an infinite number of -1's to the deck, such that we always pull -1 (killing the monster anyway) and never get the Null.",

The shape of the AoE requires a little bit of setup, but you can often body-block the monsters into the shape you want by acting as an invisible obstacle (and often this will just happen on its own if there is a pileup in front of a door you're jamming). I played in a party of 3 which was a slightly more target-rich environment, so maybe this wouldn't work as well for a party of 2, but I was reliably able to set up this combo ~2-3 times per adventure. During the perk discussion above, I'd referenced an item that would further cause us to want to build our perk deck around Silent Force's attack 8, and this is it, by nearly doubling the frequency with which that attack 8 occurs."

You can think of this item almost like another invisibility cloak (if played with Black Arrow or Lurking Ruin) that can be used instead as a mana potion in a pinch (if played with any of our Dark generators). Although almost never the best use of this item, it is also the one that enables the craziest bursts of speed. In the most extreme case, if we play Unseen Dread for the bottom (move 6) and Empowering Void for that quirky top (double all movement), then also trigger our Boots of Sprinting (move 4) and use a Ring of Haste to drop in Angel of Death (move 5), that is 2 * (6+4+5) = 30! Alternately, the same process swapping in the loss action of Silent Force for Angel of Death and we can instead move 32 and then loot 1 immediately afterwards. Not that useful in most scenarios, but probably breaks others that revolve primarily around looting or standing on a specific hex. Finally, this card can also obviate our issue of needing to play an inferior 9th card, by allowing us to play (and therefore discard) all 9 of our cards before the first long rest."
