		<p>This build is for a striker archetype whose main focus is on actions that cause damage to enemies as opposed to defensive or support actions, though there will be some of these actions in our deck due the spread of action types amongst the available cards.</p>	<p>It should also be noted that due to the large hand size you should expect to burn cards to take hits for other characters as you have a huge amount of stamina so you can off-tank no matter what your archetype is.</p>
		<p>So why would you play a Striker Build?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Can output significant damage.</li>
			<li>Has some CC actions.</li>
			<li>Hand size allows it to off-tank at times.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Striker build loves the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Complex mechanics so needs a player happy to think multiple moves ahead.</li>
			<li>Needs another melee character to off-tank at least.</li>
		</ul>

							<p>Two attack 2's is nice, but obviously shield and retaliate make this something you won't want to be using. You want to be using this against poisoned enemies to really make it effective.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Persistent loss that shuffles a <em>Bless</em> into your deck and switches form, but it allows you to convert any element into either <em>Fire</em> or <em>Light</em> at the end of your turn setting you up for the next round.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The initiative is fairly mediocre and not something you will want to rely on.<p>The bottom element manipulation is fairly strong as you have no reliable way to generate elements on your own and <em>Fire</em> is used for your ranged attacks to power them up. It can also be used to steal an element that an enemy will want for power up its attacks, such as <em>Ice</em> for enemy <em>Brittle</em> attacks. The action gets more powerful as we level up and get more ranged attacks that we can power up.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>his is a good attack allowing to lay down some CC on a couple of enemies and then switching form to ranged now that we know they are going to stay where they are so we can position a ranged AoE next round.

							<p>This is a situational attack as you are not going to be get the enemies lining up that easily for this, but when they do it is a great action if you can boost it with <em>Light</em>.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Jump 3, switch form is a great action on a late card to allow positioning for a next round ranged turn.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The 72 initiative is late enough that you should be able to go after most monsters so with this bottom you can perform a melee attack with your other card and get into position for your ranged form next turn so this turns into a card that you will want to take to every scenario and only play the top loss towards the end of the scenario.<p>Unless you can guarantee that you will kill an enemy with your other card and still be in a good position for a ranged attack next turn it should not be used as a mechanism to close on an enemy for your melee attack.</p></p>

							<p>The top loss is something that you can use when you are trying for your mastery, but outside that you should be able to manage your form switching without this loss.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>One of only 2 loot cards at level 1, but a bottom loot is never that great, though the pure damage prior may help take down an enemy, but it is unlikely that you will know that there is a 1hp enemy prior to selecting the card and also hits allies.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

							<p>This is one of our few ranged attacks that does not have a precision element and is <em>Muddle</em> all creatures in range 2, including allies plus gaining <em>Ice</em>.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The move is OK, but in ranged form we don't really want to be moving up to enemies and consuming an element that is difficult for us to gain just for wound.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The late initiative is something we can work with. The card is somewhat situational but for enemies like the Electric Eels and Ice Imps it can be good to try and limit their annoying attacks.</p>

							<p>The top loss is OK allowing us to swap an element for <em>Ice</em> or <em>Light</em>, but the <em>Ice</em> is more useful for other buiilds and this is not necessarily something we want to be doing as it would mean giving up the bottom, which is immense for us.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Move 2, self-heal is a great action for us to cleanse some of the conditions we self-impose with our top attacks.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The bottom of this card is really great for us cleansing the conditions we add to ourself during some of our attacks. We will want this card every scenario as many of our heals are ally only or tied to losses.</p>

							<p>This loss is very strong for damage, especially on ranged attacks so we really want to switch form after setting this up as it will trigger on any attack and we don't want to waste it on melee.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>A good tanking card, especially if can power it up. The initiative is good enough that we should get this up before enemy attacks most turns and it's not a loss. It is one of our few xp gains on a non-loss card.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is a very easy pick for any build with the low initiative, spammable bottom and very powerful top when the moment is right.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>The top is a really good AoE attack that has <em>Pierce</em> 3 and <em>Poison</em>, which will cut through enemies at lower levels and even be very effective later on.<p>It has a switch to ranged form so you will want to make sure you can get into position for that but those attacks tend to also be AoE so you will hopefully be able to target the enemies you just poisoned.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>A move 3 with disadvantage on a melee card usually pays off fairly well and the initiative should get you in position before most enemies can attack.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The 23 initiative isn't great, but should be good enough for most cases and both the top and bottom actions are useful. If you can get the top to line up and have cards for a follow up ranged round then it can be very powerful, but until that point the bottom is something you will be happy to use all day.<p>The top is better in higher player counts as you have a better chance of having more monsters to target.</p></p>

							<p>Even without <em>Ice</em> attack 5 with <em>Pierce</em> and an xp is a strong action and one of your largest punches until later levels.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Works well because it sets up the defensive action before most enemies will have their go.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The 14 initiative alone means that we will want this card in our hand.<p>Both halves are good for shielded enemies and as powerful as the top is we may not want to play it immediately in a scenario as it means we lose access to the initiative and the bottom. We will however want to fire this top off at some point in every scenario.</p><p>At worst this is a move 2, initiative 14, which is also great.</p></p>

							<p>This is a great top that allows us to attack at range and then pull the enemy into us ready for a melee attack next round when we switch form.</p>

							<p>A big self-heal and <em>Regen</em> loss with the chance of <em>Strengthen</em> if it is powered up.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is a very strong top attack that we would like to pair with a late initiative bottom to go move late attack and set up the enemy for a fast melee round next turn. We will want to bring this card to every scenario.</p>

							<p>Against strictly melee enemies this can be quite strong or against low health shielded enemies if you can power it up to give 2 pure damage. This is a very conditional top, but does have its uses.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Bottom attack with form switch. We always like bottom attacks and you can get some real damage out of this when paired with some other top attacks. The problem is that you will be out of position for your next melee round.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is our lowest ranged initiative and for that alone is worth bringing along. The top is very conditional and the bottom isn't great, but is usable and a fast Move 2 is fine with us in any case.</p>

							<p>An attack 2 is the default, but giving yourself <em>Wound</em> to add <em>Disarrm</em> and taking <em>Poison</em> to add an additional +2 really makes this action shine. You can pop the Amulet of Life or a self-heal action, which we have, to instantly remove the conditions.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>An attack 4 on the bottom is always a great action and if you have one of the elements it will <em>Stun</em> the enemy. There are much fewer opportunities to stun enemies in Frosthaven than Gloomhaven so even though this is a loss it has its place and is a source of xp that we want.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Another ok initiative, but both actions on the card are strong if you can power them up. The top becomes a reusable attack 4, <em>Disarm</em> which is immense for a level 1 card and the bottom is great for large health pool enemies. This is another great card that we will be happy to bring along.</p>

							<p>Top loot actions are ones that we can get behind as looting is much more important in Frosthaven and the add the addition of <em>Regen</em> makes this a great between rooms or after a round that we poison ourselves.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom here has some utility as it allows you to use short rests to change form and you can ensure that you are losing a card from the deck you want rather than potentially making your hands lopsided.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is almost the mirror of Feeding Frenzy and is far better for it. Given the requirement for looting you will want to be bringing this top, but in high-tempo scenarios where you don't want to be wasting a turn long resting the bottom comes into play, though that is likely more situational. If you are aiming for a mastery it is a useful action to have in your toolkit.</p>

							<p>This typically a couple of attack 2s, which isn't great, but it does have a small push in there as well.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>This is a good tanking action where for your next 4 turns you get shields, 2 for melee and 1 for ranged. We would really like to be in melee form when this is triggered so pairing it with a form switch top attack is likely the best action.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

							<p>Heal 3, Range 3 is decent for level 1, but it can only target an ally which is a significant limitation. If it is powered up with <em>Fire</em> it also applies <em>Regen</em> and gives an xp which adds real value. This is one of the few non-burn xp generators we have.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Move 3 switch form is a decent action allowing us to attack then get into place for our next round of melee.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Initiative 27 isn't great, but we are happy to have it on a ranged card. The top has its place, especially if we can power it up as it can help clear status effects from our melee allies. It is not necessarily a staple card for every scenario or group.</p>

							<p>The top is a basic attack 2 at range 4/5 which is weak, you can muddle yourself, which comes in before the attack to add 2 more and curse yourself to add a target. This turns it into two attack 4, though with some real downsides. You can do healing or something defensive the next round to waste the muddle, but the curse stays.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom looks like it is good as you get to <em>Immobilise</em> a couple of enemies and then jump out, but it means that the enemies need to be next to you in the first place which isn't something would be wanting to happen in ranged form.</p>

							<p>This can turn into retaliate 3, range 3 which is a massive effect and the xp every time it fires is something we like. You need to be sure that the enemies will attack and not do one of their heal/shield type actions, but if it works out is can make a huge dent in a room.</p>

							<p>Fast bottom attack with <em>Poison</em> is a great action to pair with a multi-attack top action.</p>

							<hr>
							<p>The bottom pulls enemies into melee range and if powered up does some pure damage on top. It has a long range and is powered can swap an element to one we like. It creates either <em>Fire</em> or <em>Ice</em> so is useful for both melee and ranged turns.</p>

							<p><em>Strengthen</em> yourself using an element and then do a multi-target attack 3 with <em>Pierce 3</em> is a decent action as the <em>Strengthen</em> also applies to the next round. An attack 6 at level 8 is fairly weak, but if the enemy is shielded it turns into an attack 12, which is much better especially with the buff.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is a loss that gives a one-time movement and tempo boost allowing you to use an extra melee card next round after swapping to ranged form.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This a good late initiative that allows you to burn down the annoying high shield enemies. The bottom is a nice situational effect when you come up against a boss or other high health enemy. The problem is that you are now in ranged form and unlikely to want to be in melee range so you would need to use the melee card and then move away to use the ranged action.</p>

							<p>Ranged attack 4 then swap to melee with the ability to use a ranged card after you have swapped next turn. This is actually better that the AM version as you can do you ranged attack next turn and then move into melee range and do your melee actions which works better.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Move 4, <em>Bless</em> and potentially <em>Strengthen</em> yourself is a great action you will be happy to use.</p>

							<p>This is a mirror of AM with the loss on top this time, but with a much worse initiative. The actions however are better.

							<p>Persistent loss that acts as a huge retaliate of 5 for the next 4 melee attacks against you, gaining <em>Ward</em> which then reduces the damage you take is a really powerful, if transient effect.

			<div class="w3-container w3-light-grey"><p>The Muscle Potion is certainly the strongest 2-herb potion in the abstract, but given that tanking builds should really only be played in larger parties with other damage-dealers, it's a pretty safe assumption that you have two allies who can make significantly better use of it than you.</p></div>

				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-097-explosive-vial.png">
					<p class="w3-container">The Explosive Vial can finish off damaged enemies and/or deal with pesky shielded enemies. And you'll regularly be on the front lines in a position to use it in a timely and convenient manner.</p>

				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-084-stamina-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">The Stamina Potion isn't anything exceptional but it will always provide an extra turn each scenario by using it when you have an odd hand size and let you repeat one of your more powerful level 1 cards, which is an acceptable impact.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">

					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-089-stoneskin-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">If you're really trying to go all-in on defence, the Stoneskin Potion (089) is acceptable. Ward has negative synergy with your persistent Shield, meaning this will likely represent more like two hits points than three regularly. Of course, being able to use this when you most need it against one of the many heavy-hitting enemies in Frosthaven can help keep your life total high, which is important for a tank to remain effective.</p>

				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-118-fulminant-flask.png">
					<p class="w3-container">The Fulminant Flask is just so good. The jump from two to four damage between the Explosive Vial and this has a profound effect and you'll always be well-placed to use this.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-100-major-stamina-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">Abuse it. Nerf it. The Major Stamina Potion arrives all the same. It's still very good and especially being able to repeat Hold the Line is a really big deal. Do note that you can't recover Hold the Line the round in which you play it (unlike normal Stamina Potion shenanigans) for obvious reasons, so the turn sequence is more like Hold the Line on turns 1 and 3 of a room.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-106-stonewall-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">While the Stoneskin Potion was a bit unimpressive, the Stonewall Potion is much, much better. As a tank, your job is keeping your party alive. It's not realistic to think every attack will be on you, and having an extra layer of protection on your allies (or better yet, their summons) for when they do get attacked is great. This will pretty much represent the same amount of effective hit points gained as the Major Healing Potion, only spread across three figures (which is generally a bit of a downside) but with added safety (assurance against a damage spike leading to a pitched card - which is obvious upside).</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-105-major-fireshield-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">The Fireshield Potion wasn't even worth mentioning, but the jump from Retaliate 1 to Retaliate 2 is a really big deal, making the Major Fireshield Potion absolutely worthwhile if you'd like to add some offensive power to your tanking. The choice between this and Stonewall is really going to come down to whether your party needs more protection or damage.</p>
