	<tr><td>be-01</td><td>"It'll be at least an hour to repair the beautiful maybe more." The captain looks at the crew bailing water out ofthe ship and patching the holes where she's run aground against an iceberg. "Probably more." He shrugs.  So you're here, crashed on a floating chunk of ice that could comfortably fit Frosthaven on it three times over. What's there to do?  Option A: Climb to the topmost peak and get a look around. Option B: Explore the coastline.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-02</td><td>"Cap'n? We've spotted her, upwind." A deckhand delivers the report to Captain Doghogger. You watch a flash of ambition flicker across the captain's eyes, and he turns to a shipmate in the crow's nest.  "Keep your eyes on that starfish! We won't let her get away this time! Ready the cannons! Every available hand to  an oar!" He turns and nearly bumps into you, a bit taken aback, "No time to explain—there's a starfish I've been hunting for two decades. She's as big as a freighter, and today's the day she feels my harpoon! Finally, the revenge of the ..!" He kisses a locket on a gold chain around his neck. "Agatha, it's time."  Option A: There's nothing to shoot at unless you catch it: grab an oar.  Option B: Combat is your specialty: ready the cannons.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-03</td><td>It's a cold but gorgeous day for sailing. You're making excellent time, the wind is at your back, and with any luck, ~ you'll arrive to your destination before sunset. Your gaze drifts off the side of the boat, then you spot it: a Lurker keeping perfect pace with your ship.  It breaches the surface of the water, flipping in the air before splashing back down. It locks eyes with you and you can almost feel its thoughts... it wants to race. Can that be right? Yes—yes, you're sure of it, it wants to race your boat.  Option A: Accept the challenge to race.  bi 2 o  Option B: This is undoubtedly a trap. Attack before it ambushes you.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-04</td><td>An enormous sea turtle easily twice the size of your ship pulls up alongside, making steady strokes to keep pace. 'The crew mans the harpoons, drawing down their sights. But then, against all odds, the sea turtle looks up and poses question ina slow drawl:  "Why, hello, Boat. Don't suppose you could point me to the nearest land. I'm quite tired and my eyesight isn't what it used to be."  The crew stammer incredulously, and finally the captain hollers back the question on everyone's mind: "Are youa talking sea turtle?"  The sea turtle looks stunned. "Oh my, are you a talking boat?"  Option A: Direct the sea turtle to Frosthaven.  0-4  Option B: The meat from this turtle could feed Frosthaven for months, and the shell undoubtedly has defensive applications... fire the harpoons.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-05</td><td>A glacier has broken apart ahead of you and treacherous  chunks of ice dominate the path forward, dotting the water like little mines. Each of these ice floes floating above the surface could be hiding a much larger issue under the water. You'll have to either push your way through or turn back.  Option A: It's not worth turning back; the weather should support the transit.  $0-@  Option B: The time of year won't support a journey through ice floes. You're better off taking the long way around.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-06</td><td>A combination of a late start and uncooperative winds 'has you sailing past nightfall. The sky lights up with an infinite sea of star-pinpricks stretching across the horizon. Despite the cold, you set up a sleeping pad on the main deck to rest under the majesty of the stars.  You've heard stories of Aesthers traveling to the heavens, driven mad in their quest. You've seen Quatryls attempt to conquer the sky. You've seen creatures older than recorded history, now nameless except for the monikers you've bestowed. You've seen so much of this incredible world, and still this view humbles you. One star in particular catches your eye, burning brighter than its siblings.  You concentrate, manifesting what you want in the world.  2 2 a  Option A: Dream of a vibrant, prosperous town.  Option B: Dream of a happy, bountiful town.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-07</td><td>The spotter in the crow's nest rings the bell and points off the starboard side. In the distance, you can see a ship listing dangerously and several people in rowboats heading away from it, You adjust tack and head toward the commotion.  Before you get within shouting distance, a fire erupts on the listing ship, and the flames spread quickly—the main masta burning beacon against the horizon. A moment Jater, the heat reaches the powder stores, and the ship ignites in a fireball of splintered wood. You load into your ship's rowboat and start making your way toward the wreckage as it begins sinking below the water line.  By the time you're close enough to see the carnage clearly, the survivors are nowhere to be found. Crates and detritus from the ship are scattered across the waves.  Option A: Board the burning ship and try to put out the fire.  ra 1 Ss  Option B: The ship is going under. Gather the cargo crates.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-08</td><td>A beam of gold-tinted light pierces down from between the clouds, striking a spot ahead of your ship's path. With pop of thunder, the beam crackles apart into a trail of shimmering dust, leaving a solitary metal craft where it had touched the water. Captain Doghogger drops anchor on your ship to investigate.  "Please stand by for hatch opening." A chime punctuates the ethereal voice of an unseen speaker, and after a moment, an Aesther sticks her head out of an opening on the impossibly smooth craft. She looks around, settling her gaze on you and the crew. A voice from below shouts up.  "Are we home?"  The Aesther woman shakes her head, calling back down. "No, definitely not home. Again. Start jump prep." She starts descending back into the hatch, totally ignoring you. You call out to her and she sighs—the exhalation of a tired traveler yearning for somewhere else. She turns to you: "one question, then we're gone. Make it good."  Option A: Ask her where she came from.  80-4  Option B: Offer to help direct her.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-09</td><td>Across the waves, you hear the repeating brass ring of a bell. With your permission, Captain Doghogger adjusts course to check it out. ieee  "Hello there!" A stocky Quatryl woman stops ringing the bell and is waving her hand enthusiastically at your approach. She's barely peeking out the hatch of her craft, a metal cylinder floating in the water. A massive canvas red balloon hovers over the vessel, tethered to it with a series of ropes and pulleys.  "Iwas testing my aeronautical when I discovered a peculiar shipwreck right below this spot. I managed to get all tangled up in the old anchor, and now I'ma bit rooted down. Don't suppose you could help out? I'd do it myself, but Inever learned to swim."  Looking down into the water you can see Piranha Pigs circling.  Option A: Offerto dive down and untangle the anchor from| the aeronautical.  Option B: Offer hera lift back to dry land.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-10</td><td>by the time you've dragged him on board, the Vermling has a mottled sheen to his fur from his time in the briny sea. There's no telling how long he's been in the water, and he Jooks to be in no condition to tell you.  After a few hours asleep in the hold, he wakes up ina start: "We had to burn the ship. Had to." He doesn't elaborate, and the far-off look in his eyes conveys volumes. "The Ghost Lurker. It's real." He falls silent again. The deckhand tending to him shrugs at you.  Option A: Ask him to explain how he wound up in the ocean without a boat.  Ol-d  Option B: Ask him what a Ghost Lurker is.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-11</td><td>POP. POP! BOOOOO00OM! An explosion rocks the ship from the port side, swinging the mast and throwing the crew intoa frenzy of action. You rush to the side of the ship to find the cause: ominous barrels floating on the ocean' surface. Each has been painted blue in camouflage, but they're not hard to spot if you know what you're Jooking for.  A deckhand delivers a status report: "Not too much damage to the ship... we're getting it patched up, and we'll be underway again soon. But there's a few dozen of these we can spot from the crow's nest. It' like an ocean minefield... wouldn't be surprised if someone set it for Lurkers."  Option A: Send out a rowboat to retrieve one of the devices.  TW-4  Option B: An ocean full of explosives in your path? Sounds like target practice.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-12</td><td>Violet, the Valrath researcher investigating Lurker , behavior, stands at the edge of the ship, scanning the  horizon with a spyglass. When she heard you were  venturing into the open water she begged to join you, and  you don't mind the company.  "That one!" She shouts and points excitedly. You squint, unable to make out what she's pointing toward. "That's the perfect wave!" Ina flash she pulls off her purple clothing to reveala fashionable and equally purple swimsuit. She tosses off her shoes and rushes to the back deck, grabs arope and makes the most elegant dive into the water you've ever witnessed.  Before you have a chance to raise the alarm, you hear her wild whoops from the ocean below—she's balancing on a wooden board and being towed by the ship, expertly riding the waves. With a huge smile she beckons you join her: "Get down here!"  Itactually looks fun.  Option A: Attempt to surf.  eU-d  Option B: Order her back into the ship.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-13</td><td>The wind has been at a total standstill since shortly after you departed, and the water is a mirror of calm. It could * be hours before you can get back underway, and you've exhausted all forms of entertainment on board. You're poking at a mass of algae drifting past when your boat- hook strikes glass—it's a message in a bottle! You drag it up, pop the cork, and read the contents with excitement.  "hope this message finds you well. I've found myself with some time, waiting forthe winds to pick up and carry our party to our next adventure. commit this note to the waves and hope it brings you joy some day in the future."

It goes on to describe some incredible adventures in the areas around Frosthaven and on the high seas. The whole thing reminds you a bit of your own journey, albeit more fantastical than you can find really believable. The author clearly took some liberties with the truth.  But there's an additional boon: you find a few gold coins at the bottom of the bottle!  Option A: Keep the coins and document your own journey.  a ~  Option B: Leave the coins in the bottle and write your own note back.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-15</td><td>"Blasted fishmen!" Captain Doghogger laments as a group of Abaeli riding Piranha Pigs crest up out of the ocean, shooting straight at you in a "V" formation. There are quite a few of them. "Ready for boarding!"  You prepare for a rough battle with the Abaeli when something else from below suddenly lurches the boat forward. At first, you fear it is more enemies, but then the Crashing Tide emerges from the water between you and the approaching threat. With a wave of its claw, it sends another wave at you, pushing your boat further away to make a clean escape while it engages the enemy.  "Our lucky day, boys!" Barks Doghogger. "Looks like the Lurker would rather eat some fish over our soft, pink flesh. 'Man the sails! Let's get clear of this mess!"  Option A: Flee the scene.  i ne a  Option B: Tell Doghogger to turn the ship around. There are too many Abaeli for the Crashing Tide to handle, and you need to help.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-16</td><td>Reports have been mounting about Abael pirates attacking  fishing vessels leaving Frosthaven harbor. Satha has  ¥ granted each ship a small contingent of Town Guard as a precaution. You didn't think it was necessary, but Captain Doghogger looks relieved to have the extra forces aboard.  'Sure enough, halfway into your journey, Abaeli splash onto the top deck of your boat. Captain Doghogger shouts to the  crew: "Drive them off! We have the advantage on the ship— toss them into the sea before they gut you alive!"  Maybe it's not a bad idea to have a little help after all.  Select any five cards from the town guard deck to bring as crew on board, then resolve the back side of this event.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-17</td><td>The storm swirls around your ship, threatening to drag the crew to a watery grave. A flash of lightning punctuates the driving rain as the boat lists dangerously into wave after wave.  But then you spot them slicing through the water: dozens of Abaeli swarming around four Lurkers. The Lurkers are clearly outmatched, but the inclement weather leaves you fighting for your own survival. The wind begins to pick up, and a swell of water pushes you directly toward the confrontation—your ship is driftwood being thrown around an angry ocean.  Option A: Man the cannons and help your Lurker friends.  " a 8  Option B: This is the Lurkers' domain. Get the crew below  decks to shelter from the storm.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-18</td><td>You've sat in complete silence, motionless, for what feels like an hour. You pan your head slowly around the shiy everyone is frozen in place, not daring to move a muscle for fear of announcing your presence with a creaking deck. You work up the nerve to glance over the side and down into the water: sure enough, it's still there, circling.  You don't know quite what the dark mass is—when it  first arrived, the deckhand mouthed "Leviathan" to his ship-mate. It's bigger than the entirety of Frosthaven, and judging by the looks of the seasoned crew, sitting still for an hour is an appropriate reaction to sighting it. Captain Doghogger slowly makes his way over to you.  He whispers: "He's a patient beast. He isn't moving on... We'll need to do something."  Option A: Quietly lower the sails and push forward to your | gy destination. 1  Option B: Drop something heavy into the water to give ita new target while you make your escape.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>be-19</td><td>It is a calm, relatively pleasant day out at sea when Captain Doghogger starts muttering doomed prognostications. You ask about bad weather, but he shakes his head.  "tt's not the sea," he warns. "Abaeli are close. Ican smell em."  Accouple tense minutes go by before a massive blue whale breaches the surface of the water next to your ship. On it ride a dozen or so Abael hunters. They look prepared to attack, but something gives them pause.  The Abaeli look at you and then begin arguing among themselves in a language you can't understand. Over the heated bickering, however, you do pick up on one word they repeat throughout. It's a word that stuck in your mind while dealing with Lihrey and the Fish King. You think it means "Leviathan".  Option A: Take the opportunity to attack while they are distracted.  e nN S  Option B: Wait to see what they decide.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-01</td><td>Knock knock knock! "Mail call, open up."  You open the door to find a grumpy Quatryl with a low- riding sack of mail. She tosses a lumpy package wrapped in cord to you. "No name, but this address. It's yours now!"  As she walks away she snaps her fingers, remembering something. "Oh, right. This too." She hands overa letter addressed to you. As she wanders off toward a drink, you rip the letter open to read a note scrawled in excellent cursive:  "Please do not open the package.  We will retrieve it. Leonidas and Maximus"  Option A: Open the package.  Option B: Respect their request.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-02</td><td>A young man who runs a fruit stand and a fetching girl in the town guard have chosen each other for eternal bliss. Today is their wedding day. Against all odds, Xain, your friend-in-frequent-need, is their wedding planner. He rushes up to you just before the ceremony in a mad panic.  "Big trouble," he whispers. "BIG trouble! Everything is going wrong! The groom wanted white snowbirds to be released at the end of the ceremony, but the box of birds, uh... expired, in the cold.  "Don't worry, though, I've got it covered! I caught a box full of snow imps and we'll release those, no one will be able to tell the difference. But, wh, they're naturally pretty gray, so Ineed you to paint them white." He thrusts a bucket of white paint into your hands.  "Thanks, gotta go pick red tin-berries out of the fruit salad Imade—apparently the groom is allergic. And the bride... origuess they're just poisonous. Thanks!"  'The ceremony starts in 20 minutes. You've gotta be kidding.  Option A: Paint the "snowbirds."  Option B: Try to catch enough real snowbirds in time.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-03</td><td>"Hear ye, hear ye! Lam the crier of the Great Dallum, the most powerful seer the world has ever known!" An ostentatiously dressed man is shouting in the middle of town, drawing a crowd. "It is my great honor to advise you that the Great Dallum has selected this outpost for his next visitation!"  There are audible gasps from the crowd. "He will arrive in a fortnight! Prepare yourselves and be merry!"  As the crier packs up, Frosthaven's citizenry come alive: "The Great Dallum? Here?" and "We'll need to prepare a feast!" and "We'll need an offering—I've heard he grants the wishes of those who please him with lavish donations!"  Even Mayor Satha looks to be hiding excitement under a facade of civility... this should be an event to remember,  Option A: Help clean the streets to make a good impression.  Option B: Assist in the preparation of a feast.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-04</td><td>A gentleman you haven't seen before wearing a dapper vest has set up a small table for cards on the street corner. He beckons you over.  "Three Card Monte. Familiar? Simplest game there is." He pullls out three worn cards, frayed from use, and flips them upright on the table. "Just need to watch the red queen. Ignore the spades. Just spot where she goes, nice an' easy." He flips the cards face-down and with slow, deliberate movements shuffles their positions. With a flourish he invites you to pick where the queen wound up.  You point to the queen. He flips it upright with feigned surprise. "You got it! And on your first try. Say, why don't we make this interesting?"  You agree to a wager. He shows you the queen, then shuffles the cards across the table. "Tell you what, let's make this even simpler. 'll remove this one here..." he plucks a card off the table, showing it's a spade. "That leaves just two cards. Which'll it be?" You're sure you followed the queen to the spot on the left.  Option A: Pick the card on the left.  Option B: Pick the card on the right.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-05</td><td>Aman walks through the open gates of Frosthaven, carrying a sturdy suitcase. He walks up to you with a broad smile.  "Hello! New in town. Terrible trip, really. Much too fat, much too slow. You seem like exactly the sort of folk  Iwas coming out here to see. So happy to make your acquaintances." He sets his bags down and stretches.  "Y'see, I've been working with some of the smartest Quatryls you've ever seen. They've come up with a railway  system that would let us get goods and people in and out of an outpost like Frosthaven here lickety-split."  A small crowd has gathered. "Now, that's a big undertaking, obviously, but not with the brains of these (Quatryls by your side. I expect this rail line to be up and running by next summer. I'm so confident, in fact, that I'm offering discounted tickets on the rails if you purchase them today. The ticket is guaranteed or your money back, but there's no guarantee there'll be enough tickets for everyone if you don't get them today."  2 Option A: Purchase a ticket for the future rail line. e ° a  Option B: Quatryls or not, there's no way this guy will get a railway to Frosthaven.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-06</td><td>A pretentious-looking visitor scolds Captain Olmstead, shouting for all to hear in the barracks yard.  "Shameful, just shameful. Is this how you greet an emissary from White Oak? It's a wonder you've survived this long at all! The condition of this camp—"  "Outpost, sit," Captain Olmstead interrupts. The visitor looks flustered, then spots your ragtag group.  "And look at these miserable guards! They aren't even wearing standard-issue armor!"  Option A: Excuse me? We're not guards, we're mercenaries.  Option B: Fall inline and pretend to be guards.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-07</td><td>Your latest victory is the talk of The Crater. You celebrate your heroics with one toast too many before stumbling back to your bed and falling asleep in a giddy haze.  You wake to the sound of battle—the too-familiar roar of Algox morphing from dream to groggy reality. Flames from outside cast an eerie mural on the wall of your Jonghouse. What happened to the alarm?  As your wine-soaked faculties slowly return, you notice the families that share your longhouse are in various states of panic. You've been through raids before, but it was always with a weapon in hand, facing your foe; inside the longhouse, unarmed and unarmored, you see in these people a kind of helpless terror you hadn't experienced before now.  A ctash outside snaps you from your reverie. Across the road, a group of Algox smash a stack of barrels and throw a torch into the pile before turning toward your longhouse. The other residents see them too.  Option A: Hide with the residents and keep them calm.  Option B: Make a stand at the doorway.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-08</td><td>Regardless of season, Frosthaven and the surrounding environment is covered in a blanket of snow year-round. This week shows that even the most reliable of weather can take a break every now and then: the sun is shining, the air is warm, and the icy paths have melted into mud and stone.  The outposters are taking advantage of the heatwave by enjoying a splash in the bay. The Quatryl mail-carrier has taken to delivering popsicles made with ice harvested from the shade of the mountainside, and even Mayor Satha 'has paused her duties to take a running dive off the dock into the still-cold water.  Only one group is going about as normal: the town guard. Captain Olmstead has demanded the guard be at high alert and double the patrols.  He barks orders from the harbor tower at the sweating 'guards on patrol: "Al! manner of sea life is just waiting to eat us alive! Be ready for them!" The fully-armored guards Took to be on the verge of collapse in the sweltering heat.  'Option A: Encourage Captain Olmstead to relax and let the | guards enjoy a day off. °  Option B: Safety first. It's good someone is watching out for the relaxing populace.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-09</td><td>"I'm trying to explain, that's the very root cause of all of this! They're not aggressive by nature!" Violet, the local Lurker researcher, is pleading on the street with  Mayor Satha.  "Right. And they have terrifying claws and razor-sharp protrusions because they're peaceful." Satha is having none of it. Violet is nervously balling up her purple scart, clearly on the verge of a breakdown.  "Please, you have to understand. My research suggests—" Satha cuts the Valrath off.  "Your research suggests the capital is willing to waste 'resources, Resources that could be better put to use protecting the people of this outpost from those same Lurkers you so desperately want to repaint as benevolent! Till be confiscating your supplies for the defense effort."  Option A: Come to Violet's aid—there's more to the Lurkers.  Option B: Back up Satha's assessment—Lurker research is | awaste of resources.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-10</td><td>"Care to make trade?" A man with skin rough as leather beckons you over to the stool he's set on the main street through town. "I've got the best deals on building materials, come have a chat." You wander over to hear his pitch.  "The trick is buying this junk in bulk down in the real cities, then it's ust a matter of hauling it up here. Massive profits for me, good deals for you. It'll take a few weeks toget here, but you can't beat the cost." He flips through a notepad, doing the math in his head. "I've got enough room on the next shipment to squeeze in a few more things if you're interested. I'll even cut you a better deal than these other suckers just so Ican head out before it gets dark."  Option A: Order 5 wooed and 2 metal (requires 15 gold).  Option B: Order 5 metal and 2 Wood (requires 15 gold).  Option C: Take him up on the offer some other time.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-11</td><td>Pinter Droman, Frosthaven's resident Quatryl tinkerer, is unwrapping a package wrapped in brocade in his workshop.  "Come take a look. Can't believe it. One of the guards just dropped this off. Says he found it on the hillside." Out from the cloth comes what looks like a long metallic-purple blade. "Remarkable! Believe it or not, this is an antler from a Brummix, Quatryl settlers brought them here over a century ago, but they all died out. Or so I thought."  "Watch this!" He swings a heavy wrench at the antler, snapping it in two pieces.  "Alright, let's see if the myths are true..." He grabs the two halves of the antler and gently touches them together. Like magic, the two pieces fuse back together, looking as perfect as when he first unwrapped the antler. Pinter is 'grinning from ear to ear.  "A marvel of nature! Now what should we use it for?"  Option A: Use it as a mutable material for crafting.  Option B: Weave it into an art piece.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-12</td><td>An incoming merchant ship tipped the town fishermen off to a dense school of large fish, about an hour's row up the bay. Captain Olmstead asked you to accompany and provide protection to the fishing expedition.  The merchants were right—after an afternoon in the calm water, the boat was full of enough fish to last the town half of winter. Which is why you're so dismayed when an Abael pops his head out of the water.  "Per the Treaty of Deep Bay, these are our fish. Fin them over and leave immediately." He glares at you with black, unblinking eyes. You try to explain you've never heard of this treaty, but he cuts you off. "Your disrespect for those already here and ignorance of our ways is no excuse. Give me the fish or face the consequences."  Option A: You have plenty of enemies already, and it's not worth making more. Besides, you have no idea how many Abaeli are in the water below you.  Option B: There's no treaty. This Abael is full of chum and just wants a free lunch. Keep the fish and row back to Frosthaven.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-13</td><td>A Valrath man comes up to you in the street. "Say... you spend some time outside the walls, right? Happened to come across any snowthistle?" He speaks in a low voice, and his hood makes it difficult to make out his face.  Before you have a chance to respond, a portly woman rushes up with a broom, smacking the Valrath on the back. "You again?! Leave these people alone!" The Valrath scurries off into an alley without another word. The woman turns to you, her hands on her hips.  "valraths and snowthistle, am Iright? For most people it'sa garnish, or medicinal. For them—well, they can't get enough of the stuff. Addicts!" She mumbles to herself as she heads back into her home.  You continue your walk, but hear the Valrath's voice down the alley. "So? Have any? I've got coin."  Option A: Sell the Valrath some snowthistle (requires pH).  Option B: Admonish the Valrath for his pursuits.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-14</td><td>A group of mercenaries are strapping supplies ontoa donkey-drawn wagon. A woman in gleaming armor stows a warhammer, ignoring the agitated old man nattering ather.  "Bah, go on then and rush to your deaths. There's nothing up that mountain but an unmarked grave with your name onit." He scrunches his face, struggling. "Or Ishould say without your name on it! Because it'll be unmarked, and no one will find you!"  He turns to you. "These mercenaries are abandoning Frosthaven to venture into the hills for adventure. Waste of good manpower, Isay!" The mercenaries certainly look to be on the younger side, still excited for a march outside the walls,  A plucky Quatryl gathers a crowd with notes from her lute, 'hopping onto the back of the donkey. "How about it, then? Who will fund our journey to treasure?"  Option A: Mercenaries should be supported. Help them purchase supplies in return fora cut of what they find.  Option B: The old man's right. They're walking to their doom. Try to stop them.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>soe-15</td><td>"Damn White Oak! They give us half a budget and still expect us to stay alive!"  Captain Olmstead is stomping around angrily. He punctuates his frustration by knocking a weapon rack to the floor.

After another hour of telling yourselves that the destination must be around the next bend, you're forced to admit it: you're lost.  You pause to weigh your options. It might be better to stop and orient yourselves once the stars come out... but your supplies are already dwindling from the overlong journey, and waiting for nightfall would take up valuable time you don't have.  Option A: Press on - it's got to be around here somewhere.  Option B: Camp until night and try to navigate by the stars.</td></tr>

But now, even your footsteps grow eerily silent.  One more step anda flash of light erupts from underfoot, searing pain ripping through your body. You discover you're standing in what appears to bea runic minefield—a dangerous tool of wars from ages past. You see a pack of Snow Imps descend from the trees, chittering in glee at your misfortune.

	<tr><td>wre-28</td><td>An old man, conspicuously out of place, stumbles toward you on the road. He has a thick blindfold wrapped around his eyes, and he taps his way down the path witha walking stick. "Is someone there?" he calls out, the picture of feebleness. "Could you help me? I've walked this route for ages, but I seem to have gone a bit off course. So many ne'er-do- wells about." You offer to lead him back to wherever he came from, but he waves you off and pulls a small brown envelope from his breast pocket. "No, I'm quite alright. But could you deliver this to my grandson? He's not far off the toad just ahead. He'll take care of everything from there."  It's right around where you were going anyway, so you accept the envelope and part ways. A few paces further  down the road you realize you didn't catch his grandson's name, but when you turn back to inquire, the old man is nowhere to be seen. it  Option A: Read the contents of the envelope.  Option B: Deliver the envelope unopened.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-29</td><td>The original settlers of Frosthaven needed a means of directing people back to the outpost in harsh conditions. 'Maps of the icy north were incomplete and normal signage would be quickly lost in the snow, so the founders turned to other means, Mounted beside the road is one such tool: a tall metal flagpole painted with a prominent red stripe down the side.  'The pennant that flapped in the wind has long since blown away, but the metal post itself has held up well. A sign 'mounted to the side points the way toward Frosthaven, allowing even weary travelers to find their way to safety.  You're about to continue on to your destination when a realization strikes you: that's not pointed to Frosthaven at all! Someone has altered the sign's direction to point down a trail off the beaten path.  Option A: Correct the sign.  Option B: Follow the sign's incorrect directions to see where they lead.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-30</td><td>The sun is disappearing behind the mountains for the evening. You set your pack down ona rock embedded in the snow and start setting up camp.  CRACK! The weight of your pack was just enough to break the rock free of the snow and ice, creating a small avalanche and sending your supplies tumbling offa cliff.  Winter days are brutally cold, but without a source of warmth, winter nights are deadly. You're unprepared in unfamiliar territory, sunlight is dwindling, and you can already feel your fingertips going numb. If you don't find a way to warm up or find a way through this darkness, you're going to have a rough night.  Option A: Search the remains of what you brought with you for a way to generate heat and light.  Option B: Give up and hike back to Frosthaven.</td></tr>

"Just need to get through this layer of frost. They're still good under there, they're just out of reach!" You tell him you have no idea what he's talking about.  "Radishes! I have a buyer who is willing to pay enough for me to retire on if can deliver today, but all of my radishes are just out of reach... Just. Under. This. Ice!" He smashes  the trowel against the frozen ground.  Option A: Tell him where to find some discarded radishes.  Option B: Help dig out the radishes from the iced-over ground.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-32</td><td>Crackles of energy pulsed through the air for more than an hour as you traveled, and now you've found their source. An Aesther, a being of energy with tousled clothes and long black fingernails, is carving runes into the air, shouting at the winter sky. The flourish that finishes each rune sends off crackles of purple staticand the ground shows scars of fire emanating from where the Aesther stands.  When you approach, the Aesther spins to stare at you, and you recognize the Pain Conduit. "You feel it, don't you! A massive creature, so full of pain and suffering—and it is so close!" Their black eyes flash intensely. "Iwill find it!1 will consume its agony!"  This sounds precisely like the sort of thing you want no art of, and you do your best to back away slowly. Doing 0 does not sit well with the Pain Conduit, however, who fy curves their long fingers into an arc, thrusting them at you with a scream. "Perhaps Ijustneedsomeoneelseas a focus..."  The feeling of splashing into a pool of hot water boils over your skin, and in an instant, you are somewhere else... Flip over this card.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-33</td><td>Walking out Frosthaven's main gate, you see a shimmering, armor-clad man at the top of the ridgeline. He jumps from an incredible height, landing powerfully on a bended knee, a single fist touching the ground. Drawing himself back up you recognize the face.  "Hello, fellow mercenaries! It is 1, Ormi!" If this really is the novice fighter you brought along to a fight, he's improved his capability in incredible time. His voice booms with confidence: "Perhaps you'd have room for one more on your quest?"  He sees your awe-struck reaction and sweeps his voluminous hair back with a stroke of his broad arm. "If you're concerned about splitting the loot, have no fear; I give up my share. I'm in it just for the adventure!" His perfect teeth gleam in the sunlight.  Option A: Bring him along for the fight.  Option B: Tell him this mission won't be of interest to someone of his prowess, but perhaps some later quest might be more suitable.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-34</td><td>The snow is driving harder than usual, forcing you to seek shelter under forest canopy. An old oak tree gives the best cover from the sleet, and you set up camp under the safety of the branches.  Before you can make camp, you spot it: a perfectly circular clearing around a single chunk of glowing crystal. Unlike the snowy landscape around you, this area has a warmth toit, and the grass grows green. The polished rock looks meticulously carved into a smooth platform, and a candle 'has been placed on it... someone has made a crystal altar.  An inscription on the altar reads:  Istretch to the sky,  acool blanket for my children from the sun. Rolling hills of blue-green,  white peaks my winter armor.  Hear my call. Who am I?

	<tr><td>wre-35</td><td>You approach the edge of a great chasm not far from Frosthaven's gates. The rickety wooden bridge has been retrofitted with additional ropes and chunks of metal that don't seem to do much structurally, but are certainly... there. The whole affair has been painted with a metallic gold paint that looks gaudy at best.  It's either this bridge or a swift-looking river fed by  glacial runoff below. Before you have a chance to decide, a 'hulking Algox wearing a trench coat made of polar bear fur with gold threading steps up to block your path. "Welcome my bridge! You best customers."  He continues, with a broad smile. 'Legitimate business bridge, see?" He points to the gold-painted railings, still on the verge of collapse. "Okay, enough social talk. You pay now or use death-path down there." He crosses his arms and waits.  Option A: Pay to use the legitimate business bridge.  Option B: Ford the river.  </td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-36</td><td>You're sitting on a snow-covered rock, taking a break from the long journey. Suddenly, a young Inox in a swirling blue cloak appears around a bend in the path.

"OHI It's you! Remember me? I saved you from all those undead!"  You do seem to recall an Inox and some undead, but you're pretty certain he had been bleeding out atthe time... if ; 'anything, you saved him. "\  You hear a groaning, shuffling sound coming from around the bend in the path.  "Oh, wh, right." The Inox looks suddenly conflicted. "Um, there are... several... more. Corpses, that is. Coming this way.  erg  "But 'll save you!" He comes toa conclusion. "Stay behind me!" He readies his bow as the first corpses appear around the bend. "Don't get up," he wavers, "I can, uh, handle them. No... no help needed." Option A: Well, it sounds like he doesn't need help.  Option B: Come on, he clearly needs help.</td></tr>

It is Malrog, the young Algox you generously equipped for his trials, Time has not been kind to him, but he gives a broad smile. "Today I repay my debt to you: I have something my tribe collected from a corpse of your kind."  Option A: No thanks is necessary, but perhaps we could have a hot meal with your tribe?

"YOU ARE BEING JUMPED, WE WILL RETAIN YOUR VALUABLES."  (Out steps a bipedal metal monstrosity—it towers over you. Its neck terminates in a long barrel, as though someone strapped artillery to a giant metal sculpture in the place where its head should be. It aims the head-cannon directly at you.

The creature isa deep royal purple, with dense, shaggy fur that obscures its body. Its antlers, long metallic purple blades tucked back behind its head, are caught in the thick mass of thorny vines.

It looks like the thatching caved in under the weight of a recent snowstorm, and they still havea lot of work left to do before it's weatherproof.  To your right, another group is sitting around a large fire with several pots of stew simmering over the flame. Looks like they're trying to make enough food to get themselves  through the next snowstorm. The smell wafts over to you. Itsmells delicious.

You do not know, but she's willing to draw you a picture.  After a few hours of climbing, you uncrumple the drawing of the plant you're looking for and... well, it leaves a lot to be desired.  It looks like there's red axenuts and red corpsecaps here. She was very insistent that the Crimson Plant Grove is precious and you shouldn't take more than one. Which do you bring back to Hail?

After a few hearty shoves the lid collapses to the ground, revealing three- armed skeleton in rotting silk finery. Before you have a chance to investigate, it shoots upright, locking its gaze on you.  "Each slumber feels shorter than the last; surely it's been Jess than a decade?" You detect a hint of scorn in its voice as it looks at you. "Iexpect you are here for the knowledge of my people." Gnarled bone fingers crack as they heft a tome to the rim of the coffin. "Bound in moss and inked in the blood of my kind."  "Use it wisely. My people were great once. We stood with  mankind, arm in arm in arm." Its words grow shallower, as though whatever magic reanimated itis fading. "Then your betrayal. Someday soon, you too will fall to your betters, lost to guarding ruins whose purpose you cannot recall."  The skeleton collapses motionlessly into the coffin, exuding a purple cloud of foul-smelling magic.  Option A: Attempt to use the book on him as atest subject.

	<tr><td>wre-46</td><td>The spot Eddica the Librarian marked out for you was certainly easy to find: you just had to make your way toward the ominous column of smoke and ash billowing out of the top of the hillside. The hike up was treacherous and the snow underfoot frequently crumbled away to dark pits you'd prefer not to explore. Cresting the lip of the caldera reveals a single pillar with a stone dome on top. A pool of lava swirls around the pillar and gives offa brazen heat.  You approach the dome to lift the heavy covering and the boiling rock recedes to allow you passage. Underneath is a tome covered in a beautifully-sculpted cover—the piece Jooks like a work of art. Images of the elements are carved into the rough Kivak leather as a ring of familiar circles, and ornate citrine studs bind it together. It is warm, and inviting, and impossibly light. It is breathtaking. This is the Tome of the Elements  Option A: Open the tome to learn its secrets.  Option B: Bring the book back to Eddica for her informed review.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-47</td><td>You're in the region Eddica the Librarian suggested would contain the Tome of Time, but a search has turned up nothing. Heavy snowfall forces you to take shelter in adty cave fora few hours. To your surprise you spot a small handle carefully hidden in the rock wall. With a bit of force you're able to pull open a hidden compartment containing a single object: a heavy tome with a delicate, sand-filled hourglass embedded in the cover. Two stiff metal latches hold the book shut, but if you tilt the cover just right the sand in the hourglass begins to run. So long as it's flowing, the latches release easily. You hastily flip through the pages: it looks like this is in fact the tome Eddica the librarian is looking for!  'The diagrams clearly lay out the hand positions and stances to take in casting, and the words are written in several languages, making it easy to translate. If you managed to invoke it, the spell looks like it could give some benefit in the battle you're about to head into.  Option A: Open the tome to learn its secrets. Option B: Bring the book back to Eddica for her informed review.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>wre-48</td><td>"I AM HIVE."  "NEGATORY. I AM HIVE."  You round a bend in the road to find a small armored tank arguing with a multi-propellered flying machine with many arms.  "YOU CAN BARELY MOVE IN THE SNOW WITH THOSE TREADS," the helicopter says. "CLEARLY HIVE REPRESENTS GREATER MOBILITY THAN THAT."  "IAM STURDY," the tank replies. "ONE GLANCING BLOW WILL SEND YOU CRASHING TO YOUR DOOM. HIVE SHOULD BE MORE RESILIENT THAN THAT."  "RESILIENT. HA!" The helicopter attempts to make some sort of laughing sound. "YOUR GEARS WILL GET CLOGGED WITH SNOW AND FREEZE SOON ENOUGH."  "FORMER HIVE COMPANIONS," they turn their attention to you. "WHICH ONE OF US IS THE TRUE HIVE?"

	<tr><td>wre-49</td><td>As the winds on the road pick up, and the snow begins to blast across your face, you are forced to seek refuge in a nearby cave. At first, the cave greets you with even more cold, and you find yourself huddling in deeper to escape the elements.  To your surprise, the cave begins to grow warmer the deeper you travel. The cave air feels refreshing against your skin, and gusts of wind blow leaves across your feet. Strange that you don't remember seeing any trees nearby. Your curiousity piqued, you head farther in.  At the back of the cave you find a door, into which are carved two symbols—a raging fire and a billow of wind.  As you approach, the symbols begin to throb with a soft glow: the fire yellow and the wind orange. The key that you have been carrying with you since its discovery begins to throb as well, yellow and orange lights dancing out of your pocket. There is a keyhole in the door.  Option A: Use the key on the door.  Option B: Mark the cave's location on your map and return at a later time.</td></tr>
