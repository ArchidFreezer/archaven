   <p>This build starts off playing multiple loss cards to project power, but as it progresses we play fewer and have more repeatable actions. This has te benefit of delaying the time that we need to play the top of Reviving Ether.</p> <p>The ocre of this build is the Cold Fire card we gain at level 3 which is a fairly strong attack, but with the added bonus of <i>Stun</i>, which is an overpowered status effect. At level 3 we can't fully use it as we don't have the element generation to power it up efficiently, but we will pickcards as we level up to change that.</p>
    <p>So why would you play a Cold Fire Build?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once we have Cold Fire powered up it is an extremely powerfull effect that is effective against all types of creatures, and especially good against summoners with it's <i>Stun</i> effect.</li>
      <li>One thing to note is that there are some anti-synergies with some characters such as the Mindthief that also wants <i>Ice</i> and the Red Guard if they are using the Shield Spikes buyild which wants enemies to attack. The Red Guard can be worked around by targetting outlying enemies and by the end of the room when everything is surrounding the tank then only consuming <i>Fire</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Cold Fire build loves the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As with all squishies we would like some form of tank or front liner to grab aggro.</li>
      <li>We also like party members that produce elements they do not need that we can consume </li>

              <p>The top provides an otherwise damage-focused class the ability to do a bit of healing. That's really perfect - in general, in Gloomhaven, focusing too much on healing will lead to weakening your character, but it's always good to have a bit of healing in most scenarios (the exception to this would be one-room scenarios where you're constantly fighting). Healing is typically not worth doing while in combat as enemy damage will outpace healing and thus you'd be better off killing or disabling enemies. But in between rooms/fights, people will usually be missing some hp and being able to restore some of that before the next fight will lead to losing less cards to negate damage over the course of the scenario, increasing longevity and allowing players to play more losses and thus be more effective. Healing in those situations is perfect with a top action because you'll often spend 1-2 turns moving towards the next door/setting up before you go in, in which case you can move toward the door or grab coins and top up your party.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, the bottom provides a very nice summon for a level 1 card. Melee summons in Gloomhaven tend to be mostly quite bad because their AI lends itself to them committing suicide quite frequently, but ranged summons don't suffer from nearly as many problems, and while the 2 range on this summon can be a bit limiting, 3 attack per round plus <i>Pierce</i> is a lot of damage, easily allowing this to be your loss that provides the most damage-per-card in many scenarios at early levels.<p>You'll especially find this useful on many boss fights, scenarios where the Spellweaver is typically weaker, assuming you can keep it alive. Whether you can keep it alive or not, in general, will determine how good this summon will be in your party. A strong, tanky front-line is best, but otherwise something like the Cragheart's obstacles or even just the Mindthief's CC can also go a long way.</p></p>

              <p>This is a useful card with its utility healing and baby summons.<p>Enhancing the summon attack range and movement can give a lot of added value to a scenario</p></p>

              <p>The top will be a loss for 4 attack, which is obviously terrible, unless you have Wind.<p>You cannot produce Wind yourself to buff this card in a way that actually works (the 'combo' with Ride the Wind is far, far too costly for the effect and is also really awkward to execute) but you can get it from your party-members. If you have a Brute in your party, who can create Air with the bottom of Leaping Cleave for you, you should bring this card at level 1, as in that case you'll be able to set it up before the last room and get 8 attack from a loss, which is much better. If you don't have an ally that produces Wind, you should never consider using this card.</p></p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is just a move 3 with 25 initiative, which is okay but nothing special. The Retaliate line may as well not even be there as you're an extremely squishy ranged character and you should never be taking advantage of personal melee Retaliate.</p>

              <p>The top of this card feels very good to play in a level 1 party, providing 9+ attack pretty much every time, and giving you a nice chunk of experience.<p>Because of your loss-recovery class mechanic (which we'll see later on Reviving Ether), you can more freely spend losses than many other classes, which means you'll almost always find yourself wanting to use this top in the first room to help your party with a difficult fight, and that's perfectly fine.</p></p>
              <hr>
              <p>For anytime that you don't use it right away, it has an acceptable move 3 on the bottom, which will still allow you to get something out of it while you wait for the opportunity to fire off some orbs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Fire Orbs is your signature attack at level 1.<p>The addition of <i>Wound</i> on the attacks adds some lengevity as losses which only generate damage scale poorly with levels, at higher levels it is best used againg high shield, low health enemies but that is absolutely fine.</p></p>
            </div>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
              <p>The top is your default highest damage non-loss attack although it comes with only 2 range, which is quite a bit more difficult to work around. The additional upside is that you can use the Fire you create with Fire Orbs to add Wound, netting 4-5 damage off of this attack, which is great. Otherwise, just being able to get a 3 whenever you really need it, rather than needing to worry about having random elements, helps quite a lot.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, the bottom action is your only bottom attack, which is also quite welcome. Other than the bottom of Mana Bolt, most of your non-loss bottom actions will just be moves, and it's nice to have something to do when you don't need to move.<p>The range 2 on the bottom is more limiting than the top (as you can't first move to get into range that round), which means you'll either need to go early in the round (earlier than 36 initiative, which is one problem with this card) by combining it with Mana Bolt or Frost Armor, in order to kill something before it goes, or you'll need to have someone else in your party protecting you.</p></p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Flame Strike is another card with both a good top and bottom action.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
              <p>The top action is inherently powerful, it's just not worth it for us. There is traditionally a strategy for classes like ours to use actions like this, which involves using our other card to run in very late, performing this action, and then running out very early the next round. The problem is that we only have a single very early card, Mana Bolt, and it already has an enormous amount of work to do, so we'd be hurting ourselves a lot to have to use it as a move 2 exclusively with this card's combo.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Finally, the bottom action on this card just provides laughable value for a level 1 loss card - Heal 4 isn't remotely tempting us into playing this loss. Thus, with a bad top (for us, it would be great for someone like a Brute) and an even worse bottom, this card goes straight into the junk heap.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>After some really nice cards, multiple with good tops and bottoms, we get to our first card that has no good actions on either half. The Spellweaver has a small health pool and a tiny hand size, making her easily one of the squishiest characters in the game. Accordingly, making melee attacks is just not a good plan if we want to consistently complete scenarios.</p>

              <p>The top attack here will usually be an attack 2 at level 1 but gets to be an attack 3 that generates 1 xp more and more often as we progress in the campaign (and depending on our party composition). That's not very good but is the best we can do until later so we just have to accept it.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom loss is also not very good, we'll rarely use it (most often just with Reviving Ether to get another card back to hand - more on this later) but there will occasionally be situations where it can be useful: if you know you'll have to take damage and end up losing cards anyway because of your small hp pool, might as well lose 1 card to negate two sources of damage. Still, it's more like you should look at the bottom as an emergency button rather than something you expressly try to play around.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Frost Armor is far from exciting but is ultimately just 'fine'.<p>The biggest reason this card remains relevant for a while is simply the initiative: 20 is the second-best initiative we'll get until level 9, and we often need to go fast. Accordingly, the third mode for this card, which will be used often enough, is simply a move 2 with 20 initiative. Between having two slightly below-average modes and one highly situational mode, this card does enough to earn its place for a bit. Furthermore, Mana Bolt has such a good bottom (whether heal or move 2) that having this around for the top makes it easier to use Mana Bolt's bottom.</p></p>

              <p>Melee Retaliate is generally such a bad solo top action and losing a card to get it is well and truly a losing strategy 95% of the time.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, the bottom as just a move 3 with 26 initiative is fine but we have enough move actions and the shield is almost completely irrelevant as you don't want to be taking hits in the first place and you can't even create the Ice yourself at this level.<p>By the time you can create Ice, the Shield won't mitigate enough damage to make taking hits worth it.</p?</p>

              <p>The top can theoretically be an attack 12, as opposed to Fire Orb's 9, but that's not consistently realistic as it both requires us to get into melee range of an enemy and have 4 enemies all adjacent to each other. Still, we'll regularly be able to get attack 9 from this, like Fire Orbs, just not always on the three targets we want to hit the most, rather just the targets that we can hit. The greater difficulty of effective targeting is what makes this top action weaker than Fire Orbs (as well as creating an element we care much less about).</p>

              <p>The top of Reviving Ether is actually one of the single most powerful actions for any class at any level in the entire game. Gloomhaven is balanced around your hand size diminishing as you progress through a scenario and this card can single-handedly dominate that mechanic. That being said, the counterpoint for you is that your maximum hand size is 8, so this action is more of a necessity baked into the design of this class. This design allows for you to use your loss actions twice per scenario instead of once, freeing you up to play them more liberally, which is both fun and powerful. Sadly, that aspect of this class ends up abandoned (assuming you choose to play optimally) as you level, as you'll replace your splashy loss actions with just straight-up better non-loss actions.<p>You'll also need to be very careful with your positioning when you get down to 2-3 cards in your hand to make sure you can actually get the top action here off and not be forced to lose a card and thus probably lose the scenario. The Dark generation on the top is mostly irrelevant but can occasionally be used by the top of Frost Armor or Mana Bolt.</p></p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom of this card is great because it's a move 4 with Jump, which is a very nice action and one you'll be happy to play the entire scenario while you wait to need the top.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>This is the class defining card for Spellweaver an your deck throughout the game.<p>There is one other trick worth mentioning with this card which is the ability to get back a lost card that you play the turn you play the top action. The most common candidates will be Frost Armor and Aid from the Ether (and later Cold Fire). By first playing a loss and then immediately recovering it the turn you play Reviving Ether's top, you'll end up with 7 cards in your hand instead of 6. That won't add an additional turn in terms of longevity but it will give you more options. Should you choose to keep Reviving Ether's summon active and do the trick with something like the bottom of Frost Armor, it will indeed add an additional turn, as you'll have 6 cards instead of 5, thus it is something worth paying attention to.</p></p>

That being said, there are some scenarios in the game in which the giant move on the bottom can be huge and while we'll cut this card early, you should always consider bringing it back if the objective of the scenario warrants.</p></p>

              <p>The top gives us our first non-conditional attack 3 at range 3 and the Light generation is useful for a number of reasons. At level 7 we'll get Living Torch, which has a powerful top action that specifically wants Light. In the meantime, the Light generated here will be able to be used by the top of Mana Bolt or Frost Armor each rest cycle to guarantee another one of those becomes an attack 3, thus the top of Flashing Burst is more like an attack 4, which is great at level 2.</p>

              <p>Icy Blast is the worst kind of card in Gloomhaven - a double-loss. Double-losses give you the option of either playing one of the losses immediately or being forced to play default actions. Each forced default action costs you something during the scenario and thus the eventual value from the loss effect is accordingly diminished.<p>That dynamic can be a bit upset if the default action comes with something valuable like good initiative but sadly Icy Blast has maybe the worst initiative value in the game.</p></p>

              <p>The top of Aid with Earth being a Heal 5 is honestly quite powerful for a level 3 card. Healing scales quite poorly but fortunately we won't want this card forever anyway and it can be quite good in the meantime. So when is Elemental Aid good? Well, first of all, you need a Cragheart. Even in a 2p party with a Cragheart, I still wouldn't take it because healing just isn't very good in 2p (and the Cragheart already has enough). So I'd say in any party involving a Cragheart and being at least 3p, Elemental Aid can be the choice at this level.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom of Elemental Aid seems like it could be quite powerful but unfortunately your initiative issues mean that it's very, very difficult to get it to actually work (as Shield is only useful if you go before the enemies). You can only really use it paired with the top of Mana Bolt but as you level, you want less and less to actually use the top of Mana Bolt, thus the bottom action will routinely disappoint, despite looking quite awesome.</p>

              <p>Elemental Aid, as the other level 3 option, is actually a very fine card in the right party as well, although nowhere near Cold Fire.<p>'What?!' you say, 'how can you want to take Aid over a card you just described as one of the best in the game?!' Well, you see, we're never using Cold Fire before level 5 anyway (short of a fortunate early enhancement or a Mindthief in your party) so if we don't take it at level 3, we can still take it at level 4. And fortunately for us, the Spellweaver's level 4 options are pretty mediocre, thus the choice of Aid is more over the level 4 cards than over Cold Fire.</p></p>

First of all, like I said, it prepares Cold Fire while providing a better action than a move 2. Secondly, by level 5 it's quite likely that we have been able to or we're just about to enhance the bottom of Reviving Ether with Any Element and we can combine Engulfed with that bottom action to get both elements.<p>If you don't have the Reviving Ether enhancement yet you won't be able to do full Cold Fires but you can try to get the <i>Ice</i> with modifier flips (more on that later) and otherwise the AoE non-loss attack 3 is still perfectly fine for now.</p><p>Flame Strike is still a fine card but something had to be cut and we'll just be using <i>Fire</i> for the top of Cold Fire now. The bottom attack will be missed but with Cold Fire as a payoff we'll have even more incentive to constantly reposition in order to get maximum effectiveness while keeping ourselves safe.</p></div>

In my previous version of this guide I did actually recommend taking Living Torch at 6, but after becoming a significantly more experienced player, especially with higher difficulties, I've come to the conclusion that I explained above: I just want to be playing Cold Fire as often and as effectively as I can. Accordingly, while Living Torch is very nice, I'd rather get the bottom of Chromatic for Ice generation now as opposed to next level.</p>That being said, if you do already have the Any Element enhancement, you can take Living Torch now and Chromatic at level 7.</p><p>Forked Beam was here mostly for the initiative and we have a much better bottom action here.</p><p>We could drop Flashing Burst instead,but that can be enhanced to attack 4, range 4, which is much better.</div>

              <p>Cold Front is another card I recommended in the past but further experience has lead me to revise that decision. Cold Front is a double-loss but with two powerful losses. Previously, I would just take it and try to use the top action in the first room, where it can deal some nice damage.<p>The biggest problem is just your hand size: there's just no room for this card. In the end, if you take this card on scenarios, your initiative will suffer significantly, and that's honestly just not worth it, as you're already doing some very powerful actions between Cold Fire, Living Torch, and eventually Inferno.</p></p>

'Flame on' may also be accepted.<p>Inferno also has good initiative for us, giving us a powerful effect but not requiring us to compromise our initiative, which is already shaky.</p><p>One last thing with Inferno: no matter what weapon you had before, sell it and buy a Warhammer. Warhammer is generally a pretty bad item but Inferno actually counts as a melee attack. Yeah, that's right, you can use the Warhammer to literally Stun every enemy in the room. It's pretty good.</p></p>

It's not so much about the dream of hitting 4 enemies, 4 hexes more-so just guarantees that you can always hit 3, which is amazing. It's also not a very expensive enhancement considering how powerful it is.</td></tr>

It goes towards mitigating your poor attack modifier deck and makes a real difference of the course of a scenario.</td></tr>
