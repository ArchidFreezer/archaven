   <p>The Beast Tyrant's greatest strength is on the player board: two health bars! This is by far the most health of any class in the game. It makes you an effective tank, and especially good at taking true damage from things like retaliate, traps or wounds. The goal of an Active Tyrant build is to use both your health bars as a resource. This is the fundamental principle of the build: get in there with both figures so that you can use both crowd control and melee attacks effectively. Rotate aggro between the bear and the Tyrant, or split them up at opposite sides of a room. Stick behind your allies and use your buffs to make them even better, or open a door and disarm the enemies to give your bear a turn to catch up. You can be in two places at once with this build. You can pick up loot like a ranged attacker while blocking the hallways like a melee attacker. You can stand next to your bear to become living obstacles, causing enemies to stand still because they can't reach you. It does everything! Except, you know, attack for 15 in one turn.</p> <p>As a summoner class, long rests have a natural advantage for you, because the bear will still move and attack while you are resting, and Initiative 99 will help your allies draw aggro from a bear who is dangerously low on health. Each long rest heals the Tyrant - not the bear - for 2, so if he hasn't taken damage, you're wasting resources.</p> <p>Remember that most items benefit only your character, not the bear. While items that affect allies can certainly be helpful, as an Active Tyrant you can also use normal armour, weapons and potions effectively. A healing potion is just as good for you as for a Brute, if you've taken enough damage.</p> <p>A hand size of 10 cards is average, but since you rarely play loss cards, you will often find yourself outlasting other party members. This gives you a cushion to lose cards to avoid damage, particularly to keep the bear alive.</p>
    <p>So why would you play a Active Build?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The bear is the biggest benefit of this class due to the following:</li>
      <li>The bear's starting stats are excellent. Attack 2 is not amazing, but Move 3 is generally fast enough combined with just one command movement to ensure your bear always reaches the fight in time. If your allies have cards that affect summons or grant actions to others, the bear is almost always a good target.</li>
      <li>Note that since you summon the bear into an adjacent hex on Turn 0, it can start outside of the normal starting position. This is a significant advantage, allowing it to take the focus of even the fastest enemies, and generally reach enemies on turn one without any extra help.</li>
      <li>The key to playing a Beast Tyrant properly is making sure the bear goes where you want her to go. (The bear doesn't have an official gender; I'll use female to differentiate bear from the Tyrant, who is male.) This means you need to understand the monster AI intimately, because most of the time, you won't have the luxury of playing command cards to move her around. You or your allies can stand in suboptimal hexes next to the closest enemy so that the bear moves past you; you can block the doorway so that the bear doesn't rush past you and die to a hail of arrows; or your allies can move enemies around to more useful positions, like with the Scoundrel's Sinister Opportunity.</li>

              <p>You don't generate enough Earth or Air to make this top attack worthwhile until it can justify a spot in your deck anyway.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom action is great at healing your allies' summons using your enormous health pools, or turning your allies' summons into 6 HP on the bear, but that too is useful maybe once per scenario, not the several times you'll have to play this card.</p>

              <p>As an Active Tyrant, you'll generally use this for the top action, a long-range Disarm that either protects your bear from harm or encourages an enemy to move next to them where you can bite them more effectively.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The great part about packing this card is that at any time, you can transform into a Super Bear build by using the bottom action. If you need damage more than crowd control, or if you're fresh out of heals and you're at 2 HP, it's time to turn your top actions into +3 Attack.</p>

              <p>Heal 4 on the Tyrant is fine, but not something we want to spend an entire top action on; it's usually better to squeeze in another Attack 2 with this card while you do something else.</p>

              <p>One bottom attack is always worthwhile.</p>

              <p>Disappearing Wounds is an OK card for this build, because we can't be assured of using the bottom with Concentrated Rage to get an additional Attack 5.</p>

              <p>Disorienting Roar's top looks good as a damage prevention tool, but it's tough to manoeuvre the bear into a good situation for this to work better than any of your other cards.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is a scenario-ender that will trivialize any objective to loot a faraway chest, run a gauntlet, or escort an NPC. Swap the elite archer in the back for the Scoundrel and watch the chest disappear. Swap yourself with an NPC to gain time on the clock before they rush past all the enemies. Swap yourself for your bear to reach the exit before time runs out.</p>

              <p>Your Tyrant is a ranged attacker, so he's unlikely to be in a position to push effectively, but the bear is often dangerously close to a trap and next to an enemy she just weakened, so this comes in handy often. Adding Immobilize to the bottom of this neutralises a melee enemy if you pair the card with an early initiative.</p>

              <p>As you level up, you'll be using this more for the bottom action and great initiative. Shield 1 can improve your bear's survivability a lot, or help out a fragile ally, and it comes with a decent move attached, so it's never useless.</p>

              <p>The bottom is the key to an Active Tyrant build. If you lose this in a short rest, re-roll it. The Tyrant is starved for movement, and really needs to make every hex count.

              <p>The top action is terrible. The Red Falcon is so fast it will usually fly ahead of you and die to an enemy that wouldn't have hit you this turn anyway. It only generates air once, and generating air is not worth a loss card for you.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is one of the better loot actions in the game, because your bear is always in the thick of the action, right where enemies have been dying. Kill an enemy with your natural Attack 2 and your top action, then grab their coin without having to be anywhere near. Like all loot cards, you'll rotate this out of your deck at higher levels, but it does great work until then.</p>

              <p>To use this properly, the room has to be full of enemies, and your Tyrant has to be in front, which only happens if you're opening the door yourself. Since you're so slow, this rarely happens. It's not worth spending a level up to take a card that helps you loot the chest and escape; Disorienting Roar does that already.</p>

              <p>Jaws of Death is actually better for your Active Tyrant build than a bear master, because you're likely to have enemies hanging around with 4-6 HP after you've disarmed and hit them a few times. This cleans them up without an attack roll, which is always welcome.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>On the bottom, you have a very flexible move and attack combo that gets the bear where you need it and flips a couple attack modifiers along the way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>This is a great card for us with a bottom we are happy whilst we wait for the top to proc.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
              <p>The top half of Tribal Sigil comes up often in theory-crafting discussions, because it's a massive attack boost for characters like Spellweaver who can attack at long range. 8 health is also sturdy enough to withstand a stray hit even at level 9, so you don't have to worry about a Target 2 monster card draw ruining your plan. Unfortunately, it also can't move, and having to play Disorienting Roar to reset it for another room is just painful.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom has a very exciting effect: it gives you incredible stamina by recovering Vicious Ally and Relentless Ally, giving you a ridiculous 8 cards in hand after long resting twice (or preventing damage twice) and playing Concentrated Rage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p> This could be the pick, if your team is full of 11- or 12-card classes, but having to play this as a move 2 with 91 initiative twice is just too painful. Instead, try finishing the scenario faster.</p>
