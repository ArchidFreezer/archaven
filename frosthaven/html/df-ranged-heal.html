		<p>This build is for a ranger drifter with healing providing healing and support. It is assumed that there is a party of at 4 for this build as below that the focus on support will mean the character does not contribute as much given the support function.</p>
		<p>So why would you play a Ranged/Healer Build?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Direct healing</li>
			<li>Effective at early levels so can be used from the start</li>
			<li>High Ward uptime, if wanted</li>
			<li>Good damage whilst supporting</li>
			<li>Great mobility, especially late game</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Ranged/Healer build loves the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Party of 4 to give targets for our support abilities</li>
			<li>Melee character who can be the focus of enemy attacks</li>
		</ul>

							<p>Bottom attack 3, <i>Wound</i> is another great action for a melee build and most are looking for the occasional one. The initiative isn't great as we tend to hope to move in late, go early for the attack and kill the enemy.</p>

							<p>A ranged attack 3 moving a token back is great and we will be happy to take this in the early levels.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action adding to our healing may actually be better on a melee tanking build than a support one in some ways. The best kind of Healing is in short sporadic bursts, not one giant Heal. Smaller heals get around the all too common Poison condition without huge penalty, and many classes have small incidental healing that makes a giant Heal 5 or 6 excessive and unneeded.<p>This bottom action works with anything that gives you a Heal action, such as Long Resting (4hp baby!), Amulet of Life, <i>Regen</i> or even a Healing Potion.</p></p>

							<p>Crushing Weight boasts a powerful top persistent loss that turns every basic melee attack into an Attack 4. Note that while small rapid attacks are very efficient with this Loss in play, they will also make your tracker tick down much faster!</p>
							<hr>
							<p>A bottom Heal action that moves a token back is great value, allowing you to still attack or bulk up with your top action while ensuring that your tokens never get too close to the precarious final slot. Range 2 will be awkward at times as this is a bottom action, so you do need to be in position.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>For our build the top of this card is a wash, but we like the bottom for its short ranged heal with token management.<p>The initiative, in line with our other persistent losses, is awful, but not something we are too concerned about given the way the card will be used.</p></p>

							<p>Attack 3 AoE loss. Even for a melee build with CW you are unlikely to get the enemies to line up nicely so you can expect maybe 3 at best and more probably 2, making this an attack 10 loss, which is reasonable but not great for a last room loss.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>This is the only bottom ranged attack we have and with Precision Aim becomes Attack 4, Range 3 and we can maybe hope to target 2 enemies.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is the latest in a long line of double loss cards and these need to have something compelling abut them to make the cut. In this case that would be the Initiative which at 14 is our best and beats some of the enemies we will encounter.<p>We will use this as an early Move 2 for most scenarios, but that is good enough at level 1.</p></p>

							<p>Even with Precision Aim up this is only an attack 2 and will burn through tokens. The enhancement slot does not allow status conditions either so we can't even use that to improve the action. Locking down ranged enemies with the <i>Muddle</i> is about all this is likely to be good for, but that can be a powerful play.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Move 3 on its own is a fairly good action, and we should be able to find an enemy to gain the token manipulation and this becomes an action we will want to use every cycle.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The top has some use against ranged enemies to lock them down, but outside those it is very weak even if enhanced and will burn tokens.<p>We take this card for the good bottom action and the initiative, which is fine for us.</p></p>

							<p>Attack 3, <i>Pierce</i> is a great top that a melee build would be happy to play every cycle, but we aren't one, though this is our strongest attack in case we end up in melee range.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is much more situational, but that's fine with combined with a great top action. This is the kind of ability I love to have access to but loathe to actually play, as it means that the scenario is probably falling by the wayside. I don't think spending 2-3 turns on setting this up and your Persistent Losses is going to be a recipe for success unless you can afford to take a couple turns off, and then you are going down to an 8 or 9 card hand. In short burst style missions this has some merit, but I don't foresee this being a staple, turn 1 Loss kind of action.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This isn't a great card for our build as we are not melee, but it is the best top in case we end up in melee range at the start of a scenario.<p>The bottom is very situational, but when you need it you will be glad it's there.</p></p>

							<p>This top is our only base Heal 3 at level 1, which does mean it has the potential to be our beefiest heal if you are leaning into Continuous Health's Persistent Loss ability. Two, Initiative 20 is also a great boon, being one of our fastest actions at level 1, and something you generally want to do early. Despite this however, I suspect this is probably the most 'cut-able' level 1 Heal, as the other 2 are bottom heals and one of them moves a token back a space.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is unfortunately a little overkill on the movement side of things, especially if you have Sustained Momentum active for a casual total of Move 9. While it's obviously good value with the right Losses active, it falls into a standard problem where the Drifter simply cannot afford to play too many regular Burns. Again, this could be a good final room play to move, kill a monster, and move again and grab a chest or some loot.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is one of our staple heals, giving out a decent amount of Health at a good range. It is also a good initiative for us so we can hopefully get it out to an ally before they take any more damage.</p>

							<p>This is the core ranged attack persistent, adding both range and damage. There is only a single extra damage, but the additional range will quite often be the difference between having a target and not.</p>

							<p>Ranged retaliate persistent loss. Retaliate is not a great effect outside of some specific high shield, low health enemies and in may scenarios this would chew through your tokens in a couple of rounds. However, when facing Flame Demons and the like dishing out 12 pure damage for a loss seems like a price worth paying, if only you could keep them within range 2. The late initiative is also an issue as you need to set this up the round before and then try and move into range of the demons hoping they won't move away.</p>

							<p>Another sustained persistent loss, this time for movement. This is a very situational action and for longer scenarios or escort missions it might be very useful, but in an Alamo it adds no value. A basic move 4 is a joy to play with.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>A melee attack 2 is not something we are interested in, but in specific scenarios we may want to play the bottom persistent.

							<p>The bottom is pretty much what I would expect out of a 'last room' kind of Burn, where you trade longevity for immediate contribution/effort. Opening the door, spiking something at range for 3 or 4 damage, and still getting to do your top action is great, but Drifter is a class that isn't going to want to play a dearth of non-persistent Burns, due to going down to 9 or 10 cards with his Persistent Loss cards he will have in play at this point.</p>

							<p>For a melee build this is a sweet action providing multiple things we would like, attack, healing plus a token.</p>

							<p>Precision Aim bumps this up to a Range 4 Attack 4, which should all but ensure you get the free token assuming you pick the right target (and don't draw a Null). This is a fantastic staple action that is a good payoff for being a Ranged Drifter, which is an archetype that will definitely burn through tokens, especially if you use both Aim and Barrage from Level 3.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is also amazing, being a Move 4 with upside. It does not seem difficult to kill something and move forwards afterwards to get your token back and probably grab the loot that dropped.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Gift of the Prey is everything we could want, and 'activates' Barrage if we are running that persistent. We want both halves of this card, which is always a good sign for its power level. Even pure Support Drifters probably take this card to contribute to the fight and have a nice simple move 4, as we have only had a single one of those at this point, and you probably use that for its top a good portion of the time (Deadly Shot).</p>

							<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey ">Gift of the Prey is a no-brainer at level 4. Remember that Fierce Barrage and Precision Aim should be active, so that is an Attack 4 at 4 range with 2 targets, and if either of the enemies dies you get a use slot back (we only regain one though, regardless of kill count)<p>We drop Destructive Fury from the deck. While the bottom is nice, Gift of the Prey does pretty much the same as a non-loss (though obviously as a top action, but we should be using bottom actions to heal). If we don't need the extra movement we can drop Sustained Momentum as a persistent if we are struggling with tokens and use Deadly Shot for the movement instead.</p></div>

							<p>Well, if you thought Like the Wind's bottom could move tokens back, it has gotten usurped pretty quickly. This is the kind of action that looks super gimmicky and for a ranged build these are free tokens as it is considered a melee attack therefore we won't be using any Precision Aim tokens. It's even pretty reasonable on other builds who are okay wading in close to enemies, simply to flip modifiers and move back a bunch of tokens.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is a nice situational Persistent Loss that could definitely put in a lot of work, although my primary concern is the best enemies to do True Damage to in base Gloomhaven were all squishy, high shielded ranged enemies, who typically have no reason to enter a hex adjacent to you. Not a bad thing to have available with how spammable the top action is, however.</p>

							<p>The top action is definitely neat and has some obviously cool synergy with Shield actions, however in practice by Level 9 I feel like you get hit a lot more for 5+ than 1-4 damage, so it is pretty specialized in that sense. It's also awkward that it doesn't save you from the actions you are most likely to have to lose a card to, especially unexpected 2x's drawn by a monster or an untimely Brittle.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Adding an extra target to a Heal 3 Range 3 Regenerate Strengthen is pretty incredible value, and any action that can Self Strengthen repeatedly (especially when tied to other effects) is going to have my attention. This isn't the strongest action for a level 9 in the world, but it's likely going to be a workhorse.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This card is a bit underwhelming for a level 9 the top is short duration with only 4 slots, though the effect can be powerful on a tank who has other damage mitigation sources so it may not proc that often.<p>The bottom is a good support action, let down by the very late initiative which means that the ally will have gone before this action is played.</p></p>

							<p>Use Every Part's top action is pretty absurd with the right coordination and positioning from your teammates, and it's hard to find fault with such an efficient action. it's good for nearly any archetype of Drifter, although obviously some are going to be more excited about it than others. Healing potentially multiple allies for 4 while dealing a pretty good amount of damage, and is another action that pairs well with Fierce Barrage's bottom.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action definitely has a combo-sort of feel to it, as just like Just the Wind before it, this is the kind of action where you want to dump everything into movi'double dip' on the Move and Attack values both being modified by many of Drifters persistent abilities.</p>
