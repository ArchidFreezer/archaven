    <p>This class is a melee-damage dealer with a medium-sized health pool and a whole new bag of tricks. He tends to play as a solo character with little group interaction.</p>
    <p>The nightshroud has a few core strengths as he has the ability to:<ul><li>Be invisible, almost always</li><li>Consume Dark to automatically kill, or do massive damage, without losing cards</li><li>Manipulate initiative to an extraordinary extent (which is one of the keys to point 1)</li><li>Jam doors, shielding teammates from all monsters without ranged attacks and/or flying</li><li>Regularly gain 20+ XP per scenario (before scenario bonus XP)</li></ul></p>
    <p>On the flip side, the Nightshroud also faces a few challenges:<ul><li>Inflexibility: accomplishing all of the aforementioned lofty goals comes at a cost: one must plan carefully in advance more than any other class, such that every single card played, in the correct order, is a cog in a complex machine. (Ironically, this will result in some of our actions being quite underwhelming in the short-term, as they are intended primarily as setup for a later nova action.) Death incarnate needs to keep to a strict schedule.</li><li>Card count / Loss actions: With a hand of only 9 cards, each one is precious and playing cards as losses will risk early exhaustion. Also, losing cards prematurely is tantamount to needlessly removing cogs from the previously-mentioned complex machine, which can cause serious problems.</li><li>Movement: This one will get a lot better as we level up, buy enhancements, and acquire equipment, but out of the gate at level 1 this character is possibly the slowest in the game.</li><li>Resting: Related to the first point, the Nightshroud can almost never afford to short rest, as removing a cog from the machine at random is extremely risky. During a long-rest will, incidentally, be one of the few times you are at risk of being hit, unless you get help from an item or ally to turn invisible again.</li><li>Traps: For the first several levels, this class has no access to jump movements or push/pull attacks, and can't afford to waste money or body/enhancement slots on a jump item or enhancement. That said, we have a surprisingly large health pool (medium progression) and almost never get hit, so I quickly became our party's resident expert at disarming traps for the group (using my face). For the Nightshroud, hit points (friend and foe) are just a state of mind.</li></ul></p>
