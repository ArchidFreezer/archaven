    <p>The Doomstalker is a medium-hp, giant hand-size ranged damage-dealer; and ranged damage-dealer he is, as he can pump out some really high damage from quite far away, and that's pretty much all he does. Limited crowd control or utility of any other sort does make our role and gameplay pretty straightforward, but fortunately, just about every party can use some more damage, as damage is typically king in Gloomhaven. Being a Ranger, we also have a very large summoning sub-theme which is almost a complete failure, with very few of the Summon actions ever being worth performing. We also have a bit of the Trapping theme as well, which are again typically pretty bad actions. Thus, while we can perform some very powerful non-loss turns, we also have a TON of garbage actions clogging up our hand from the beginning. Accordingly, effective non-loss actions will be at a premium, allowing us to consistently perform effective turns despite the mass of bad actions we're saddled with.</p>
    <p>Our Doom mechanic, which requires us to perform a bottom action to apply a Doom, typically needing to be applied to our target before attacking (as many of our attacks are pretty weak without a Doom), means we have a unique rhythm to our play where we want to make big moves and then stand still for a bit, and then repeat. Accordingly, small Move actions are typically not good for us unless they come with some real benefits as we want to spend as few turns performing Move actions as possible.</p>
    <p>I really cannot overstate this point either: <b>you shouldn't be obsessed with playing all of your cards every rest cycle at low levels</b>. Sure, at high levels you'll have some better losses and thus less longevity margin, but at low levels we have almost no good losses and a ton of longevity, which means that we should spend that longevity to be more effective through shorter rest cycles.</p>
