   <p>This Red Guard build centres around the Shield Spikes card that retaliates damage based on the Shield value at the time of the hit. This means that the build is not overly interested in the AMD or damage abilities, focussing instead on consistently increasing our shield value. We use both enhancements and items to increase this value. Because some of the decenbt shileding items are not found until higher wealth levels the build can feel a little underwhelming at the start if these have not been unlocked yet.</p> <p>Applying the <i>Immobilize</i> status effect is also very useful to us as it means we can lock down ranged enemies so they do not attempt to move away and we can get our retaliate to proc.</p>
    <p>So why would you play a Shield Spikes Build?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong against the typically difficult high shield/retaliate enemies.</li>
      <li>Strong against swarming enemies as they tend to be low health, low damage and our shields can negate much if not all the damage, whilst dishing out direct damage back.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Shield Spikes build loves the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Party members who can provide us with <i>Shield</i> or <i>Immobilize</i> enemies. There is a great synergy with the Sawbones persistent loss that gives a permanent shield 1, and even better with the upgraded version that allows us to ignore negative status effects. The Spellweaver, Tinkerer and Voidwarden also have cards that can help.</li>
      <li>Party members that can heal us, especially at lower levels when we have loiwer shield values.</li>
      <li>Unusually we want to be hit a lot so <i>Stun</i> is not something we want on adjacent enemies, we are happy to have them draw a <i>Curse</i> as that means they still attack.</li>
    </ul>

              <p>The top is excellent if you have the elements, but… you don't. A top move is not very good on this build, because all our good shields are either top actions or tied to moves, so it doesn't really add anything.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is also a just okay loss, which means it's not really viable in this build.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
              <p>On the top, we have an Immobilize, which is decent for locking down a ranged enemy so they have to eat our Shield Spikes. Initiative is very late, which is actually good; it means we can ensure we go after the enemies. A good sequence is to use this late initiative to immobilize an archer, then next round set up a full Shield turn to kill it.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is, again, less desirable because it's a non-movement bottom that isn't super useful.</p>

              <p>This is Flaming Sickle's twin, but it's a bit less desirable because we care about Light less than Fire.<p>Overall, this would be a card that I'd be happy to take… if there weren't better ways to Immobilize enemies and make Light.</p></p>

              <p>A great late initiative with a very consistent and powerful The top is an essentially range 2 Disarm, which is quite good. Sometimes there are enemies you really can't put up enough Shield to deal with, so preventing them from attacking while come in clutch. The elements also help out allies like the Voidwarden or Mindthief.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is an emergency loss that will normally only be used in escape scenarios or to snag a chest from underneath a teammate.</p>

              <p>The top is a loss that can be decent against high shield/low health enemies (and it synergizes well with our Pull abilities), but using a second loss on a 10 card hand that plans on taking lots of hits is just much too risky.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom, however, is great for us. Move 4, Shield 1, initiative 6 is everything we could ask for. It lets us position to tank a hit and goes early enough to beat almost any monster. The only problem is that <i>Fire</i> will be the one element we never have enough of, but the payoff is worth it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>The 6 initiative is your best and is really insanely-good initiative for this type of class. Finally, the Fire consumption is a nice bonus that often doesn't matter much because you want Fire so badly for other actions.</p>

              <p>The top action is significant for being your only non-loss <i>Fire</i> generating top at level 1. Given that Flame Shroud needs <i>Fire</i> and is a key card for this build, that's kind of a big deal. The pull also synergizes with your Shields, letting you ensure that monster focus remains on you.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is also a <i>Fire</i> generator, which is good for the same reasons described above, but slightly less valuable because as a tank, you often need to keep moving in order to protect your teammates and/or avoid unnecessary hits.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Overall, this is a card that makes it into our hand until we find a better source of Fire.<p>The initiative is very subpar; not fast, but not slow enough to reliably go after monsters.</p></p>

              <p>The top is an excellent top self-heal that is great for getting back any life lost while moving between rooms (and as the team tank, you'll be taking some damage that should be removed). It also gives an unconditional XP, which isn't super notable given that there are many go-to cards that do the same thing.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is… okay. On average, this will essentially be a -1 to enemy attacks, meaning it's essentially a more complicated Shield 1. That's great… except you can't use Shield Spikes to deal damage back.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Initiative-wise, this is on the wrong side of the fast/meh border, especially compared to some of your other cards.<p>Overall, this is a card that can definitely find a place in a level 1 hand, but after that it depends on your team comp; do you have allies that can reliably heal you (think Tinkerer, Voidwarden, spoilers)? If so, you can leave this at home. Otherwise, it will be necessary to keep this around for longer than it deserves.</p></p>

              <p>The top is a powerful attack action at good initiative… provided we have the elements for it. As we've seen though, we're starved for Fire and would prefer to use it on Flame Shroud. Light is much less of a problem to get once we take a look at the X cards, but the consumption here is also less desirable than Twirling Stabs or Shocking Advance. Forget seeing this as a double target Attack 4, more often than not this will be a single target Attack 4 that maybe triggers a trap, which is good enough for a level 1.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is an extremely powerful loss for this build; at this level, Shield 3 may as well be “take no damage this round,” but again, we're already running a loss in Shield Spikes; the longevity cost isn't really worth it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>The initiative is extremely good, and at level 1 that'll be the main draw of this card (we have excellent early initiatives on our “Shields up” turns, but much worse on our off turns).</p>

              <p>This is our core persistent loss.<p>Shield Spikes is a class-defining, build around card. Now, I know what anyone who's done a bit of base Gloomhaven is saying; “That's just Retaliate with extra steps, and Retaliate sucks!” To that I'd say; yes, retaliate sucks in base Gloomhaven, but that's because most retaliate abilities in base Gloom are an either/or with putting up Shields, so you take more damage than usual to deal… an unpredictable amount back. This lets you do both at once, which is a huge improvement. Additionally, as we'll see in a bit, you have access to a fair amount of immobilize effects, letting you trap enemies who would otherwise run away from you into taking damage from your spikes.</p></p>
              <hr>
              <p>Oh, right, there's a bottom here; it's a decent heal, and will always be useful for clearing poison and wound. It's also one of your only non-loss bottom Fire generators at any level, which is why it's somewhat worth taking along early even if you don't want to use Shield Spikes. Obviously though, the main point of this card is the top.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Shield Spikes persistent loss is the core of one of the two builds for the Red Guard and unlike some alternative builds for classes in Gloomhaven, the Shield Spikes build has everything it needs to shine.<p>Initiative is in the bad zone (mid-range is just too inconsistent, but odds are you aren't carrying this in your hand for long enough to matter.</p></p>

              <p>The top is one of only 2 top Shield actions we have at level 1, though it does require Light, and thus it competes with Twirling Stabs. However, the Immobilize synergizes nicely with the Shield (as described on Blinding Sickle).</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is one of our best Light generators, and has an enhancement dot that looks ripe for a Fire enhancement. My first recommended enhancement would be to put a Fire on there ASAP. Having an easy way to move and make Fire will be key, and having a card that makes both your main elements nicely sets up cards like Shield of the Desert.</p>

              <p>The top is a decent double target short ranged attack. Attack 2 isn't going to win awards, and doesn't scale well against shielded enemies, but the pull will sometimes be useful. More often than not, this top will only be used if the enemies pull a non-attack card when you were planning on shielding up and you need something to do. In that capacity, it does its job well.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is the main draw of this card; <i>Jump, Shield, Loot</i> and early initiative are a great combination for tanking, letting you get in the perfect spot to maximize mitigation and damage.

              <p>Obviously with both elements, this top represents a lot of damage. And fortunately, for the only build that's taking this card (Standard), we just picked up Prismatic Sickle, which creates a very obvious and effect two-turn combo with this top.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, for every time we can't set up the elements with Prismatic Sickle's top, we can just use this bottom after a Harvest Sickle in order to get a good Move with a ton of direct damage.</p>

              <p>The top is a perfectly fine loss to use in the last room as it outputs a reasonable amount of damage and obviously AoE Stun is pretty much the best thing you can be doing in Gloomhaven.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Paired with a powerful last-room loss on top, we have a perfect bottom action to spam. Move 3 Jump + 3-4 Shield is perfect for justifying Shield Spikes and the 11 initiative is beautiful for this sort of effect. We even have access to Wind thanks to Flying Sickle from level 6, so it's easy enough for us to get the full Shield 4 when we want it (it also makes perfect sense as you'll use Flying Sickle bottom when there's a single strong enemy to kill with Strangling Chain top but when there's not, you can use the top to set up this bottom).</p>
