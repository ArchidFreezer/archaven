		<p>The deathwalker melee build is a high risk, high reward build that takes what is a fairly low health character into melee range. As with other builds of this nature it needs to use initiative weaving to stay alive.</p>	<p>Unlike the ranged build this one only needs to keep one shadow moving with them as it's attacks are typically keyed to the number of shadows on the board without reference to their location, especially at early levels. Later on shadow proximity can help but by then you should have enough that it isn't an issue.</p>
		<p>So why would you play a Melee Build?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>High damage output, even at very low levels</li>
			<li>Fairly simple mechanics</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Melee build loves the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Melee allies that can take the focus of enemy attacks</li>
			<li>Support allies for healing and CC</li>
		</ul>

							<p>This is going to attack x + 1 where x is the number of shadows on the map so obviously this is potentially a non-loss attack six which is repeatable at level one which is obviously insane.

As with Chain Hood, any form of Shield stacking alongside your persistent loss is very, very powerful. And Sturdy Greaves are much easier to use as well.

					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-099-major-healing-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">Much like its smaller cousin, the Major Healing Potion is going to be your best 3-herb potion.</p>

					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-118-fulminant-flask.png">
					<p class="w3-container">The Fulminant Flask is just so good. The jump from two to four damage between the Explosive Vial and this has a profound effect and you'll always be well-placed to use this.</p>

				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-100-major-stamina-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">Abuse it. Nerf it. The Major Stamina Potion arrives all the same. It's still very good and especially being able to repeat Hold the Line is a really big deal. Do note that you can't recover Hold the Line the round in which you play it (unlike normal Stamina Potion shenanigans) for obvious reasons, so the turn sequence is more like Hold the Line on turns 1 and 3 of a room.</p>

				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-106-stonewall-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">While the Stoneskin Potion was a bit unimpressive, the Stonewall Potion is much, much better. As a tank, your job is keeping your party alive. It's not realistic to think every attack will be on you, and having an extra layer of protection on your allies (or better yet, their summons) for when they do get attacked is great. This will pretty much represent the same amount of effective hit points gained as the Major Healing Potion, only spread across three figures (which is generally a bit of a downside) but with added safety (assurance against a damage spike leading to a pitched card - which is obvious upside).</p>

				<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:250px">
					<img class="card-med" src="images/frosthaven/items/fh-105-major-fireshield-potion.png">
					<p class="w3-container">The Fireshield Potion wasn't even worth mentioning, but the jump from Retaliate 1 to Retaliate 2 is a really big deal, making the Major Fireshield Potion absolutely worthwhile if you'd like to add some offensive power to your tanking. The choice between this and Stonewall is really going to come down to whether your party needs more protection or damage.</p>
