   <p>Sunkeeper is an amazing tank, a very solid single-target melee damage-dealer, and she also can bring numerous valuable support tools depending on your group's needs. She does, however, have two weaknesses: she completely lacks top action ranged Attacks, which makes her inflexible in terms of movement/targeting for dealing damage. She also has one of the slowest average rates of experience gain in the game, which is a serious issue for a tanking class as it's important for tanks to remain at or above the average level of their party.</p> <p>There are two main builds: Damage and Tanking/Mitigation. Focusing mostly on tanking and mitigating damage will be more effective in larger parties and less realistic in a two-player party or in parties with lots of support and little other damage (allies like a Tinkerer). This build focuses on the Tanking/Mitigation choices.</p>
    <p>So why would you play a Tank Build?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong tanking abilities</li>
      <li>Works in nearly any party</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Tank build loves the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loves a Sawbones in the party for the persistent shields.</li>
      <li>Loves the Plagueherald/Soothsinger combination spreading curses and giving enemies disadvantage.</li>

              <p>The bottom is a not-bad loss card. I don't recommend using it frequently, but if you're about to fight a boss or go into a tough room, 6 rounds of guaranteed Light will significantly increase your effectiveness for a period of time. You also have an 11 card hand size, meaning you can certainly afford a couple losses here and there when necessary. This bottom will get more mileage for you at lower levels (where it's also great for free XP) before you have access to more ways to create Light, and you can normally bench it once you can create Light consistently, just bringing it in when you see Poison or Wound as being an4 issue based on the enemies in a scenario.</p>

              <p>Attack 3 Muddle is a bit underwhelming for an attack, but it's significantly improved by the situational ability to enhance the attack when you can use Dark. This enhancement will pretty much always be done at the expense of Dark created by enemies, rather than allies, as almost any ally who creates Dark will usually want to use it as well. But when it happens, even if it's not often, it feels great.</p>

              <p>The top of Dazzling Charge is the important half and it has a couple things going for it. To begin with, it's a fine Heal, on the same level as starting heals that other classes have, and it's always nice to have a useful out-of-combat top action to play when moving from room to room. The reason it's so helpful to you is the guaranteed source of Light. Now it's not the best source of Light for a damage-dealer because you don't want to have to take a turn off during combat to heal most of the time, but many times it will be worth it. Once you have more options for sources of Light, you can bench this card if healing isn't a priority for your build of the Sunkeeper (based on your party's needs).</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is also not a bad loss. Again, not on the same level as some of your others, but being attached to a good top makes the situational value of it a lot more appealing. There will certainly be times when a Move 5 and Stun, creating a Light to set you up for next turn (towards which end Stun also contributes), will be worth it.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Dazzling Charge is a card that will certainly fit into your hand early on but may not be as important to you later as your deck changes and you gain more access to Light.</p>

              <p>The top (which is mostly just there for scenarios with harsh movement requirements that prevent the use of the bottom) is an unconditional Attack 4, which is good enough for a level 1 card. On top of that, if you can spend a Light, you get an Attack 5, 1 XP, and Advantage on the attack. At level 1 this will be slightly more conditional than the Scoundrel's level 1 Attack 5's, but also better because of Advantage. Over time, as light generation becomes easier, it will be significantly better than the respective attacks from the Scoundrel, making you a very solid melee damage-dealer.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Gaining a permanent one Shield is pretty huge in Gloomhaven on a melee character. It's not too hard to make sure you're constantly in front of your party as, lacking ranged Attacks, you naturally want to move into melee range anyway. The amount of damage this action will mitigate in an average scenario is pretty shocking. The drawback here is very real - constantly limiting your movement is a huge penalty and you'll need to work hard to overcome it, but it's definitely worth it. It's also worth mentioning that you can dismiss (move this card from active to the lost pile) this card when you desperately need to move further at the end of a scenario. There may also even be a few scenarios with very harsh movement requirements where you won't want to play this persistent loss, although those scenarios will be few and far between.<p>Almost no matter the situation, you should pretty much always try your best to play this bottom action on turn 1 of each scenario.</p></p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>Defensive Stance is THE defining card for the Sunkeeper.<p>We haven't talked about the biggest deal on the bottom action: the little enhancement dot next to the 'Shield 1.' This enhancement may very well be the most cost-effective enhancement in all of Gloomhaven and should be done as soon as possible. I'd typically buy just a couple items to start (Boots of Striding, Iron Helmet, and a small potion or two) and then immediately start saving to get this enhancement. Shield increases do not scale linearly - Shield 2 is more than twice as strong as Shield 1. Why? Because as you reach higher Shield values, it becomes easier and easier to simply accept incoming Attacks. Accordingly, this enhancement takes an already-powerful action and completely supercharges it.</p></p>

              <p>The top is a Stamina Potion for a friend. It can sometimes even come up that you use this powered-up with Light when moving between rooms, although not really consistently. Still, it's a significant, welcome bonus on an already-great top support action.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>And while the top is excellent out of mostly combat, the bottom can be amazing in combat . Attack 4 on bottom on a level 1 card is incredible. Obviously it comes with the caveat that you have to make an ally do it, but as long as you have at least one melee ally, it shouldn't be a problem. With two, it's extremely easy.</p>

              <p>The top is not very good - a loss for Heal 5, 1 XP is almost never worth it. If you can double it with a Light, it certainly can become worth it, although there's a problem with healing that has elemental requirements. Normally, when you need healing, you need it NOW, not a turn from now. This is because most of the time you want to be killing enemies and not healing, you usually only need healing when something went wrong or when moving between rooms/cleaning up with nothing else to do. If you're moving between rooms/cleaning up, it's not very likely that a) you have the Light to spend, because you probably spent it killing off enemies and b) you want to use a loss card anyway. If something went wrong, it's impossible to say whether you'll have a Light ready or not. Finally, even if you have Light ready and want healing, it's not guaranteed that two different targets will both really need the healing that badly. Thus, while this top can be a powerful heal, it rarely will be.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Fortunately, the bottom is a bit better. Attacks on bottom are always welcome, although this class does have plenty going on for it with bottoms that aren't just movement (and you really need to move with your bottom action most of the time), so it's less necessary than for some other classes. Still, the bottom Attack is fine, and the main thing making this card playable.</p>

This is a great example of a good situational loss card. The card is only let down by its terrible initiative for a crowd control card - disables like Disarm or Stun are typically better if you can be sure to go before your target, whereas this will require another card to go early (something you mostly lack). Fortunately, Stun is much better than Disarm when used for the following round as you can disregard the enemy entirely, rather than still having to worry about certain monster deck flips, so it's still almost never bad.</p></p>

              <p>Move 2 Bless an ally is great. Often you'll be fighting in close quarters in a room before moving on to the next and you should have the opportunity to move next to an allied melee character and give them a free Bless before making an attack (or attack then move). Obviously this gets significantly worse if you don't have any melee allies as it's much harder for you, as a melee character without top ranged attacks, to Bless a ranged ally and still have an effective top action.</p>

              <p>Protective Blessing top provides a lot of value but is difficult to use. Realistically, the only effective way to use this action is if you go last in the round the turn before opening a door, such that you can still use this out of combat but also get the benefit from both the Strengthen and the Bless. When moving from room to room, Dazzling Charge and Empowering Command (seen later) will both typically be better support actions, so you're not desperate for another one of those. And when you're in combat, you really don't want to waste your top action on such a marginal effect.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Meanwhile, the bottom suffers from terrible initiative and being a bottom action. You have to move into the correct spot and also hope to go before the enemies on a class that doesn't routinely break 20 initiative, so that's quite a gamble.</p>

              <p>Both for your melee Attacks and your tanking, you typically want to move almost every turn (especially as your movement is reduced).

              <p>Attack 4 isn't impressive at level 3, but it gets the job done. More importantly, this creates Light for you, which is very important.

              <p>The bottom loss isn't terrible either, there will definitely be times when moving all your allies across the battlefield will be worth a loss, the biggest problem is that you can't move with them. Still, having that option attached to something you're always happy to use means that when that situation arises, you'll be ready.</p>

              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is fine. The effect is reasonable mitigation, although you'd typically rather mitigate incoming damage by moving into position and Shielding yourself (see: Righteous Strength) rather than allow too many of your allies to take attacks (because you already have built-in mitigation with Defensive Stance). The biggest selling point of the bottom is the Light generation but you already have one of that per rest cycle with Mobilizing Axiom and you don't desperately need another (it's welcome, but not essential, although it does get better at level 5).</p>

              <p>The top is another one of those 'nothing to kill, can still do something productive' cards (and it gives experience, which you'll be super happy to get).</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The real reason for this card is the amazing bottom: Move 2, Shield 1 with 18 initiative is amazing!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>So the Sunkeeper does get sub-20 initiative! Righteous Strength is great.<p>Whether you're going full-blown tank or not, you'll never be unhappy with this card. With Defensive Stance up, getting to Shield 3 is a pretty magical place where all the monsters simply want to give you a hug and you repay them with the Light's burning vengeance. You can enter rooms with this alongside Cautious Advance (for the impervious Shield 4 turn) and assure your party that you're not concerned with who or what is in the room. And even just in the middle of combat, getting to move a bit for a top Attack at 18 initiative and mitigate some additional damage is never bad.</p></p>

              <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey ">Overall, Engulfing Radiance is certainly an acceptable card but it just can't compare to the all-around amazing Righteous Strength. Righteous Strength replaces Glorious Bolt. Glorious Bolt was just around for the bottom but it was a pretty awkward bottom and it obviously doesn't scale well so it's easy to replace here.</div>

              <p>Path of Glory has a great top which is a straight upgrade to your previous versions of this action (Defensive Stance and Hammer Blow). Especially as you typically want to play Defensive Stance bottom from the beginning of almost every scenario, adding another, better Hammer Blow top is great. Additionally, getting some Attack 5's for the baseline is a good direction to go when you unlock Weapon of Purity at level 7.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is a pretty bad loss. There's essentially no opportunity cost to have a 'situational' loss on bottom here, but this loss doesn't really seem to be designed around a situation that can possibly arise. If you're in a tough spot and want to spend a loss to help out, this doesn't even have a guaranteed immediate effect. And if your allies have a bunch of summons and you want to dump the Bless deck into their AMDs, you can just play Righteous Strength twice with a Stamina Potion for a much, much lower cost.</p>

              <p>Scales of Justice has a situational yet extremely powerful top loss. There are three real drawbacks to playing this loss: losing a card, losing access to the bottom action, and reducing all of your Attacks by 1. So where should you use this top? On essentially any scenario that involves numerous melee enemies. Retaliate is generally not the best strategy in Gloomhaven, but dumping Retaliate 2 on top of your already-existent Shield 2 is a spicy mixture that functions very well together. If enough melee enemies will Attack you over the course of the scenario, the costs here will easily be worth it. Just be careful that there aren't enemies in the scenario that will make you regret losing access to the Stun (very hard-hitting enemies or summoners).</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is extremely consistent. Light consumption here is purely bonus - sometimes you'll want it, other times you won't need to move far or your boots will be enough. No matter the situation, a bottom Move + Stun action is always incredible and you'll never miss an opportunity to use it.</p>

              <p>Attack 5, 1 XP, and it can Strengthen allies. The only thing that makes it a bit awkward in terms of the Strengthen effect is the initiative timing - how does this work exactly?

              <p>Some classes are good at executing enemies and some are not. The Sunkeeper is best off leaving that to the others who do it better.<p>Where I start considering this card is when you add a few summons into the mixture, at that point this bottom can be pretty absurd. It's still hard to pull off though because you can't move and use it in the same turn, meaning the summons need to already be in range of you and adjacent to their targets, which if you have much experience with summons or cats, is basically like trying to tell a cat what to do.</p></p>
