          "This Red Guard build centres around the Shield Spikes card that retaliates damage based on the Shield value at the time of the hit. This means that the build is not overly interested in the AMD or damage abilities, focussing instead on consistently increasing our shield value. We use both enhancements and items to increase this value. Because some of the decenbt shileding items are not found until higher wealth levels the build can feel a little underwhelming at the start if these have not been unlocked yet.",
          "Applying the <i>Immobilize</i> status effect is also very useful to us as it means we can lock down ranged enemies so they do not attempt to move away and we can get our retaliate to proc."

        "benefits": [
          "Strong against the typically difficult high shield/retaliate enemies.",
          "Strong against swarming enemies as they tend to be low health, low damage and our shields can negate much if not all the damage, whilst dishing out direct damage back."

The Spellweaver, Tinkerer and Voidwarden also have cards that can help.",
          "Party members that can heal us, especially at lower levels when we have loiwer shield values.",

It lets us position to tank a hit and goes early enough to beat almost any monster. The only problem is that <i>Fire</i> will be the one element we never have enough of, but the payoff is worth it.",

This lets you do both at once, which is a huge improvement.

          "Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.",

          "top": "Saw has some really powerful losses, even at level 1 with things like Booster Shot and sometimes Vaccine, so the bar is quite high and this largely falls short. Why? A bunch of reasons:<ol><li> Healing losses are typically the worst losses in Gloomhaven. Healing just isn't something you normally want to do as a primary action in combat because it's basically just putting a band-aid on huge gash - you help with the symptoms, but you're not addressing the problem that lead to the symptoms, and thus things will just get worse again next turn. Typically, if you're in a bad spot, you're better off using a loss for a big attack or crowd control in order to survive combat and then heal up afterwards. For example, it's almost always better to use an Attack 4, Stun loss than a Heal 6 loss.</li><li>Even if you would desperately want healing badly enough to play a loss, this is delayed healing, so it doesn't even immediately address the problem. You have to play this and then wait another turn to just get the effect, which is insane!</li><li>Med Packs are a useful mechanic that we'll play with a fair amount on this class but the biggest thing med packs do is giving extra longevity (free turns), whether played for healing or default actions. A large med pack and a small med pack give the same amount of longevity, only one of them actually costs longevity to give.</li></ol>",
          "bottom": "The bottom non-loss is quite powerful (because immunity to negative conditions removes existing conditions) and is a bonus to movement. The problem is the initiative which means that the immunity comes after most enemy attacks will have happened so we would need to pair it with another lower initiative card to make the card really effective.",
          "overall": "Battlefield Medicine starts us off at a pretty low point. This card is simply not good, although it can be powerful on some scenarios. The biggest problem is that it's a loss combined with a highly situational effect. "

          "bottom": "Bottom Loot actions are generally quite bad (because you can't Move and Loot in the same turn, thus you're better off typically just moving and picking up coins by being on top of them at the end of your turn) but at least this one is attached to a top action that we want every rest cycle so it's pretty free to have it there and will mostly just help in scenarios that require Loot actions.",
          "overall": "Bloody Saw, on the other hand, is a very good card.<p>The initiative is pretty good, although we have some really good initiatives, still this card's initiative will matter because of the combo with Hold Back the Pain (seen later).</p>"

Fortunately, as we're a melee character who's likely to take a fair number of hits each scenario, many times the target will just be us. That being said, we're not actually going to have this Heal action for very long, as we're only keeping this card at low levels or if we intend on playing the bottom loss, and if we're playing the bottom loss, it's typically the earlier, the better.",
          "bottom": "The bottom loss is excellent if we have any sort of tank or tanky character in our party. With a Sunkeeper or Red Guard this action becomes overpowered as they are naturally tanky on their own and this is a significant boost to already powerful classes. Thus, it's more if you have a tanky melee ally, use this bottom loss as early as you conveniently can in most scenarios on that ally and watch them (and your whole party) enjoy the significant increase in damage mitigation.",

The top will still end up being useful outside of combat though, so neither half is bad.",
          "bottom": "It's often going to be more convenient to simply use this bottom action, which provides you with a 19-initiative Move 3, to remove the condition and instead still get to play a meaningful top action.",
          "overall": "Ultimately though, while being a nice card, our deck has a ton of nice cards, which means that beyond early levels, this isn't a card that's going to go into our deck by default. Instead, you should consider bringing it to each scenario on an individual basis depending on the negative conditions present.<p>It's decent against Poison-rich scenarios and it's excellent against Shaman (who can Disarm and Immobilize), excellent against level 4+ Wind Demons, Spitting Drakes (where you can get Stunned but also they do Muddle so it still does something), etc. So consider the scenario and the enemies and if it seems that there are enough conditions to merit this card, bring it.

          "overall": "The initiative is also a lot worse here, as the 60-70 range is typically the worst initiative in the game (neither able to reliably go before or after enemies). That being said, we just don't have that many Attack actions, so even one that's worse than another we already have isn't terrible for us (and Bloody Saw is also a really good Attack, so this being a bit worse still makes this fine, if not exciting)."

          "bottom": "So yeah, this bottom action... As I said in the introduction, this class often gets a bad rap as it's misunderstood as being a 'support class.' Does this bottom action look 'supporty' to you?! No, it looks insane! Any melee Attack you want can be a huge AoE! That scales incredibly well with levels and items. And it starts off as just letting you do an Attack 3 Wound on all adjacent enemies with 25 initiative.<p>It gets truly absurd at level 8. So how should you use this combo? You typically want to try to run in late so that the enemies go before you and you can get into a good spot safely (Hamstring [2] bottom Move is the natural combo), then go early in the next round with this combo. Obviously, you'll need some backup from your allies to help CC or kill some of the targets or you risk taking a lot of damage, but given the power level of what you're doing, they should be happy to help out.</p>",

Take this card, keep it close, spam the top every chance you get, and laugh maniacally at the 25% of people who rated this class as 'underpowered.'",

          "bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is extremely powerful, giving us hard CC on a bottom action that also adds Poison for free (this would be a fine bottom Attack at just Attack 1, Stun - compare to the Brute's Attack 2 on bottom or the Scoundrel's Attack 3 on bottom at level 1). You can easily move next to an enemy late in the previous round, then go early with this excellent initiative, Stun them, Poison then, and then benefit from the Poison with your top Attack as well (bonus points if your top Attack is Bloody Saw, where the Wound + the Stun here will do 2 extra damage)! Again, with actions like this we're combining good damage and CC, which makes us both a formidable damage-dealer who also prevents damage (the best kind of support).",

In order for this to work, everyone needs to move in a specific way and they also all need to be at ideal points in their rest cycles where this gives back a meaningful amount of cards. Beyond that, this really needs to be done out of combat because of your lack of a combat-oriented top action combined with the movement restrictions for your allies, but recovering discarded cards out of combat is a lot less impressive (because you don't get to replay your best actions). Still, the effect can be impressive, so there's certainly room for the right party to try to build around this action, but on average I'd recommend just forgetting about it and focusing on the powerful and consistent actions you can perform regularly.",
          "bottom": "While the bottom isn't bad, it's also not great as our nature of being a melee-attacker/CC'er relies on us needing movement more than our allies, thus while technically more powerful than a Move 4, it's typically going to be worse.",

And because Poison gets better the more health the target has (as it will represent more damage), this action scales amazingly with levels and difficulty. Being ranged lets us apply this to high-hp targets (which are typically slow but hit hard) without putting ourselves in danger.",

The most common use for the bottom will be on scenarios with a lot of Poison that are also short and where you have a tanky ally (allowing you to put this and Booster Shot on the same ally). Again, that represents a large longevity cost, so the scenario does need to be short.",
          "overall": "Vaccine is, I believe, the most underrated level 1 card in the game.<p>More than anything, more than all the talk about how effective this top action is, the biggest value is in flexibility. Aside from this top action, we are entirely melee. Having a single ranged Attack adds sooooooo much flexibility into how we can still be effective in a huge variety of combat situations. Just ask any Brute how good Spare Dagger is for them - it's not because the action is that powerful, it's just because a single ranged Attack on an otherwise melee class will get an enormous amount of use. And this action is much, much more powerful than the already-excellent Spare Dagger.</p>"

Also, if our allies are long resting or catching up with us (as we have some great movement compared to many classes) when between combat, we can play this bottom with First Aid top to give out two med packs in a turn, which is sweet.",

          "Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.",

          "top": "Saw has some really powerful losses, even at level 1 with things like Booster Shot and sometimes Vaccine, so the bar is quite high and this largely falls short. Why? A bunch of reasons:<ol><li> Healing losses are typically the worst losses in Gloomhaven. Healing just isn't something you normally want to do as a primary action in combat because it's basically just putting a band-aid on huge gash - you help with the symptoms, but you're not addressing the problem that lead to the symptoms, and thus things will just get worse again next turn. Typically, if you're in a bad spot, you're better off using a loss for a big attack or crowd control in order to survive combat and then heal up afterwards. For example, it's almost always better to use an Attack 4, Stun loss than a Heal 6 loss.</li><li>Even if you would desperately want healing badly enough to play a loss, this is delayed healing, so it doesn't even immediately address the problem. You have to play this and then wait another turn to just get the effect, which is insane!</li><li>Med Packs are a useful mechanic that we'll play with a fair amount on this class but the biggest thing med packs do is giving extra longevity (free turns), whether played for healing or default actions. A large med pack and a small med pack give the same amount of longevity, only one of them actually costs longevity to give.</li></ol>",
          "bottom": "The bottom non-loss is quite powerful (because immunity to negative conditions removes existing conditions) and is a bonus to movement.

          "overall": "Battlefield Medicine starts us off at a pretty low point. This card is simply not good, although it can be powerful on some scenarios. The biggest problem is that it's a loss combined with a highly situational effect. "

          "overall": "Bloody Saw, on the other hand, is a very good card.<p>The initiative is pretty good, although we have some really good initiatives, still this card's initiative will matter because of the combo with Hold Back the Pain (seen later).</p>"

Fortunately, as we're a melee character who's likely to take a fair number of hits each scenario, many times the target will just be us. That being said, we're not actually going to have this Heal action for very long, as we're only keeping this card at low levels or if we intend on playing the bottom loss, and if we're playing the bottom loss, it's typically the earlier, the better.",
          "bottom": "The bottom loss is excellent if we have any sort of tank or tanky character in our party. With a Sunkeeper or Red Guard this action becomes overpowered as they are naturally tanky on their own and this is a significant boost to already powerful classes.

Instead, you should consider bringing it to each scenario on an individual basis depending on the negative conditions present.<p>It's decent against Poison-rich scenarios and it's excellent against Shaman (who can Disarm and Immobilize), excellent against level 4+ Wind Demons, Spitting Drakes (where you can get Stunned but also they do Muddle so it still does something), etc. So consider the scenario and the enemies and if it seems that there are enough conditions to merit this card, bring it.

And it starts off as just letting you do an Attack 3 Wound on all adjacent enemies with 25 initiative.<p>It gets truly absurd at level 8. So how should you use this combo? You typically want to try to run in late so that the enemies go before you and you can get into a good spot safely (Hamstring [2] bottom Move is the natural combo), then go early in the next round with this combo. Obviously, you'll need some backup from your allies to help CC or kill some of the targets or you risk taking a lot of damage, but given the power level of what you're doing, they should be happy to help out.</p>",

You can easily move next to an enemy late in the previous round, then go early with this excellent initiative, Stun them, Poison then, and then benefit from the Poison with your top Attack as well (bonus points if your top Attack is Bloody Saw, where the Wound + the Stun here will do 2 extra damage)!

In order for this to work, everyone needs to move in a specific way and they also all need to be at ideal points in their rest cycles where this gives back a meaningful amount of cards. Beyond that, this really needs to be done out of combat because of your lack of a combat-oriented top action combined with the movement restrictions for your allies, but recovering discarded cards out of combat is a lot less impressive (because you don't get to replay your best actions). Still, the effect can be impressive, so there's certainly room for the right party to try to build around this action, but on average I'd recommend just forgetting about it and focusing on the powerful and consistent actions you can perform regularly.",

It might seem like we really should cut Bloody Saw, but we just need the extra top Attack (even more-so in this build as we don't have Amputate) and the good initiative to go with Hold Back the Pain. Cutting a fine level 2 card over our level 1 cards should also help to demonstrate just how good some of our level 1 cards are."

The problem is when is it actually good? In order to use this, you need to be somewhere you're going to get attacked multiple times. But in most of those situations, attacking first and then moving will usually save you more health by virtue of being able to avoid attacks, and movement is always helpful. This might be better against ranged enemies, but against ranged enemies you usually need to constantly be moving in order to close the distance and kill them one by one, and standing still to absorb their attacks only works if you have a ranged Attack to damage them with. You do have one ranged Attack but it's usually going to be used when you enter new rooms and can't make it to enemies rather than when you're already there, which is what this requires.",

Early (typically approximately 25 or lower) initiative is very important in Gloomhaven in order to perform your actions before monsters act and late (typically higher than 75) initiative is also quite important in order to set up your turns such that monsters go before you and move toward you without reaching you to perform Attacks. Being right in the middle of the two while still on the late end is really the worst spot possible. 60-75 initiative is generally the worst initiative bracket in the game.</p>"

In that case, you'd rather be moving away or using something defensive most of the time, not adding one to your Attack. Even Attack 2 on the bottom of Spare Dagger is much better in the aforementioned situation because you have a better chance of eliminating one enemy and only being attacked by one, whereas here, unless the one extra Attack is enough to finish someone off, you're in trouble.<p>Compounding things, here you have to use this first to get the benefit. For example, if you get an unlucky modifier on your attack with the top attack when using Spare Dagger on the bottom to kill an enemy, you can now, at worst, use Spare Dagger's bottom as a Move 2 (or 4 with boots) to get away and not get pounded. Because you have to use this bottom first, you're doubling down on the risk of getting a bad modifier, which is a very Brute problem if you've ever seen his modifier deck in action.</p>",

The problem with healing yourself (or healing in general) while fighting is that you do it instead of something else, which usually means you're not eliminating enemies as quickly as you should be or not avoiding damage, which can negate or diminish the effect of the Heal. By being able to set this up BEFORE you get into a big fight, you get all the upside of healing without the downside.

Once we get access to Immovable Phalanx top at level 6, we'll have a perfect combo for this card where we get to both go early enough most of the time and stack multiple instances of Shield, which makes them both better.

The truth is that we took Skirmishing Manoeuvre for the bottom more than the top and that was at level 5, this action at level 8 is really just underwhelming. The biggest reason people will take this card is to play it with Immovable Phalanx loss, but then you're still getting rid of your best non-loss action, you're accepting poor initiative, and it's still not very good against a big portion of Gloomhaven monsters that have Shield or Retaliate.",

Provoking Roar was ultimately just our weakest card and the most logical to replace. That being said, if you're facing the 'Guard' monster type, I would typically recommend bringing Provoking Roar over Eye for an Eye as Guards have their two fastest initiatives precisely at 15. Accordingly, 10 is a significant difference compared to 18 against Guards."

This bottom will get more mileage for you at lower levels (where it's also great for free XP) before you have access to more ways to create Light, and you can normally bench it once you can create Light consistently, just bringing it in when you see Poison or Wound as being an4 issue based on the enemies in a scenario.",

The reason it's so helpful to you is the guaranteed source of Light. Now it's not the best source of Light for a damage-dealer because you don't want to have to take a turn off during combat to heal most of the time, but many times it will be worth it. Once you have more options for sources of Light, you can bench this card if healing isn't a priority for your build of the Sunkeeper (based on your party's needs).",

At level 1 this will be slightly more conditional than the Scoundrel's level 1 Attack 5's, but also better because of Advantage. Over time, as light generation becomes easier, it will be significantly better than the respective attacks from the Scoundrel, making you a very solid melee damage-dealer.",

It's not too hard to make sure you're constantly in front of your party as, lacking ranged Attacks, you naturally want to move into melee range anyway. The amount of damage this action will mitigate in an average scenario is pretty shocking. The drawback here is very real - constantly limiting your movement is a huge penalty and you'll need to work hard to overcome it, but it's definitely worth it. It's also worth mentioning that you can dismiss (move this card from active to the lost pile) this card when you desperately need to move further at the end of a scenario. There may also even be a few scenarios with very harsh movement requirements where you won't want to play this persistent loss, although those scenarios will be few and far between.<p>Almost no matter the situation, you should pretty much always try your best to play this bottom action on turn 1 of each scenario.</p>",

This enhancement may very well be the most cost-effective enhancement in all of Gloomhaven and should be done as soon as possible. I'd typically buy just a couple items to start (Boots of Striding, Iron Helmet, and a small potion or two) and then immediately start saving to get this enhancement. Shield increases do not scale linearly - Shield 2 is more than twice as strong as Shield 1. Why? Because as you reach higher Shield values, it becomes easier and easier to simply accept incoming Attacks.

Normally, when you need healing, you need it NOW, not a turn from now. This is because most of the time you want to be killing enemies and not healing, you usually only need healing when something went wrong or when moving between rooms/cleaning up with nothing else to do. If you're moving between rooms/cleaning up, it's not very likely that a) you have the Light to spend, because you probably spent it killing off enemies and b) you want to use a loss card anyway. If something went wrong, it's impossible to say whether you'll have a Light ready or not. Finally, even if you have Light ready and want healing, it's not guaranteed that two different targets will both really need the healing that badly. Thus, while this top can be a powerful heal, it rarely will be.",

Still, the bottom Attack is fine, and the main thing making this card playable.",

This is a great example of a good situational loss card. The card is only let down by its terrible initiative for a crowd control card - disables like Disarm or Stun are typically better if you can be sure to go before your target, whereas this will require another card to go early (something you mostly lack). Fortunately, Stun is much better than Disarm when used for the following round as you can disregard the enemy entirely, rather than still having to worry about certain monster deck flips, so it's still almost never bad.</p>"

I believe that you need three sources of Light per rest cycle to make this loss easily worth it, so that would be Mobilizing Axiom, level 8 card, and one enhancement of Light on a Move action (Tactical Order).

It's still hard to pull off though because you can't move and use it in the same turn, meaning the summons need to already be in range of you and adjacent to their targets, which if you have much experience with summons or cats, is basically like trying to tell a cat what to do.</p>"

She also has one of the slowest average rates of experience gain in the game, which is a serious issue for a tanking class as it's important for tanks to remain at or above the average level of their party.",

You also have an 11 card hand size, meaning you can certainly afford a couple losses here and there when necessary. This bottom will get more mileage for you at lower levels (where it's also great for free XP) before you have access to more ways to create Light, and you can normally bench it once you can create Light consistently, just bringing it in when you see Poison or Wound as being an4 issue based on the enemies in a scenario.",

The reason it's so helpful to you is the guaranteed source of Light. Now it's not the best source of Light for a damage-dealer because you don't want to have to take a turn off during combat to heal most of the time, but many times it will be worth it. Once you have more options for sources of Light, you can bench this card if healing isn't a priority for your build of the Sunkeeper (based on your party's needs).",

At level 1 this will be slightly more conditional than the Scoundrel's level 1 Attack 5's, but also better because of Advantage. Over time, as light generation becomes easier, it will be significantly better than the respective attacks from the Scoundrel, making you a very solid melee damage-dealer.",

It's not too hard to make sure you're constantly in front of your party as, lacking ranged Attacks, you naturally want to move into melee range anyway. The amount of damage this action will mitigate in an average scenario is pretty shocking. The drawback here is very real - constantly limiting your movement is a huge penalty and you'll need to work hard to overcome it, but it's definitely worth it. It's also worth mentioning that you can dismiss (move this card from active to the lost pile) this card when you desperately need to move further at the end of a scenario. There may also even be a few scenarios with very harsh movement requirements where you won't want to play this persistent loss, although those scenarios will be few and far between.<p>Almost no matter the situation, you should pretty much always try your best to play this bottom action on turn 1 of each scenario.</p>",
          "overall": "Defensive Stance is THE defining card for the Sunkeeper.<p>We haven't talked about the biggest deal on the bottom action: the little enhancement dot next to the 'Shield 1.' This enhancement may very well be the most cost-effective enhancement in all of Gloomhaven and should be done as soon as possible. I'd typically buy just a couple items to start (Boots of Striding, Iron Helmet, and a small potion or two) and then immediately start saving to get this enhancement. Shield increases do not scale linearly - Shield 2 is more than twice as strong as Shield 1. Why? Because as you reach higher Shield values, it becomes easier and easier to simply accept incoming Attacks. Accordingly, this enhancement takes an already-powerful action and completely supercharges it.</p>"

If you can double it with a Light, it certainly can become worth it, although there's a problem with healing that has elemental requirements. Normally, when you need healing, you need it NOW, not a turn from now. This is because most of the time you want to be killing enemies and not healing, you usually only need healing when something went wrong or when moving between rooms/cleaning up with nothing else to do. If you're moving between rooms/cleaning up, it's not very likely that a) you have the Light to spend, because you probably spent it killing off enemies and b) you want to use a loss card anyway. If something went wrong, it's impossible to say whether you'll have a Light ready or not. Finally, even if you have Light ready and want healing, it's not guaranteed that two different targets will both really need the healing that badly. Thus, while this top can be a powerful heal, it rarely will be.",

Attacks on bottom are always welcome, although this class does have plenty going on for it with bottoms that aren't just movement (and you really need to move with your bottom action most of the time), so it's less necessary than for some other classes. Still, the bottom Attack is fine, and the main thing making this card playable.",

          "overall": "Holy Strike is a tale of two halves.<p>While it's definitely not one of the better loss cards in your deck, the fact that the top half is so incredibly spammable means you lose nothing by keeping the option around. This is a great example of a good situational loss card. The card is only let down by its terrible initiative for a crowd control card - disables like Disarm or Stun are typically better if you can be sure to go before your target, whereas this will require another card to go early (something you mostly lack). Fortunately, Stun is much better than Disarm when used for the following round as you can disregard the enemy entirely, rather than still having to worry about certain monster deck flips, so it's still almost never bad.</p>"

Well, with a different initiative, it wouldn't be particularly impressive. But Feedback Loop is a hidden all-star just because of the 79 initiative. The Mindthief actually gets a ton of great early initiative but truly lacks late initiative. Late initiative is extremely important on this class for two reasons: you're a squishy often-melee class, so you want to be able to run into the enemies after they've acted, not before. In addition to that, you have non-loss Invis at levels 1 and 9, which you typically want to follow with a late initiative. Thus, Feedback Loop, a card that doesn't seem nearly as splashy as others like Perverse Edge or Frigid Apparition, actually keeps them company until we find a replacement at level 3.</p>"

Still, at level 1, the stats are pretty decent and sometimes it will be worth bringing it out in the middle of the fray. Unusually, this summons is not a persistent loss so has much more value than normal and so can be used as a meat shield in combat as well as the standard use of late in the round to get a go the next round early.",

The biggest strike against this card is that we already have Feedback Loop, which adds Jump at the cost of having 3 worse initiative, which is a very good trade.</p>"

Fortunately, Into the Night already goes pretty early, so you've got that covered, but that does mean you'll really want to make sure you have another card with late initiative to go the following round (otherwise you can just long rest, but you - or more accurately your allies - don't always want that to be your turn in the middle of combat).</p>"

So for us, the only realistic ways to consistently use the bottom action here is with Scurry top or by moving next to an enemy late and then attacking it twice early the next round. The problem with the latter is we already have Into the Night and Perverse Edge for these same situations and both of them are more often than not better (because they're more consistent in that we know we won't get hit when we're Invis or by a Stunned enemy). And with Scurry, we already have a number of bottoms that want Scurry top, so Scurry is pretty overworked.

The issue is that this ability to execute is actually so strong in most scenarios that it's worth playing top Loot actions in combat just to execute the next turn. And when you consider that you can also enhance Dark on Moves, it really starts to get out of control. In general, I mostly avoid using executes like this because it makes the game less fun for you and the rest of your group (because damage ceases to matter on most enemies).

We drop Empathetic Assault as something has to go here and we are replacing one good bottom with another, but with a much better top."

Well, with a different initiative, it wouldn't be particularly impressive. But Feedback Loop is a hidden all-star just because of the 79 initiative. The Mindthief actually gets a ton of great early initiative but truly lacks late initiative. Late initiative is extremely important on this class for two reasons: you're a squishy often-melee class, so you want to be able to run into the enemies after they've acted, not before. In addition to that, you have non-loss Invis at levels 1 and 9, which you typically want to follow with a late initiative. Thus, Feedback Loop, a card that doesn't seem nearly as splashy as others like Perverse Edge or Frigid Apparition, actually keeps them company until we find a replacement at level 3.</p>"

Still, at level 1, the stats are pretty decent and sometimes it will be worth bringing it out in the middle of the fray.

Fortunately, Into the Night already goes pretty early, so you've got that covered, but that does mean you'll really want to make sure you have another card with late initiative to go the following round (otherwise you can just long rest, but you - or more accurately your allies - don't always want that to be your turn in the middle of combat).</p>"

Stunning enemies is the second best thing an action can do in Gloomhaven, aside from just killing them, and you're absolutely going to want to do your best to use this to that effect every rest cycle.</p>",
          "overall": "In my opinion, this non-loss bottom action makes this into the best starter level 1 card outside of The Mind's Weakness and Reviving Ether. Getting to Stun an enemy with a bottom action while still having your top action to Attack is incredible.<p>We can even increase the range on the bottom or add a Wound to the top attack for a very powerful combo.</p>"

So for us, the only realistic ways to consistently use the bottom action here is with Scurry top or by moving next to an enemy late and then attacking it twice early the next round. The problem with the latter is we already have Into the Night and Perverse Edge for these same situations and both of them are more often than not better (because they're more consistent in that we know we won't get hit when we're Invis or by a Stunned enemy). And with Scurry, we already have a number of bottoms that want Scurry top, so Scurry is pretty overworked.

The issue is that this ability to execute is actually so strong in most scenarios that it's worth playing top Loot actions in combat just to execute the next turn. And when you consider that you can also enhance Dark on Moves, it really starts to get out of control. In general, I mostly avoid using executes like this because it makes the game less fun for you and the rest of your group (because damage ceases to matter on most enemies).

I think it's slightly better to take Dark Frenzy first because Corrupting Embrace is as its best once we're level 8 and Dark Frenzy bottom is probably the best action of the 4 (which is saying something) but it honestly doesn't make a huge difference either way. We should have used our summon enough for the perk point at this stage so we drop the card as we have 2 other Move 4+ cards. If you still don't have the perk you can drop Hostile Takeover until you do."

If you end up going for the Expose build, Bless on that dot is one of the more exciting enhancements you can do on an otherwise pretty boring-to-enhance class. And Strengthen on that dot is one of the biggest selling points of not needing to go for the Expose build. So either way, we're going to like this card to begin with, and it's going to become stellar with enhancement (which, conveniently, it being a top Loot action will lead to happening sooner rather than later).</p>",

					"id": "cripplingnoose",
					"top": "Trap actions are typically really bad in Gloomhaven because you need to spend a turn setting it up and then have another action with gets the monster into the trap. So you have multiple requirements and a delayed effect. And meanwhile, the actions are typically not balanced around all of that. For example, here, an Attack 4, Stun loss at level 1 is pretty mediocre to begin with. This is 4 direct damage instead of 4 Attack, which is typically better, although because it's a trap, it can't affect most of the enemies where direct damage is best (because they fly). So this top action asks you to jump through a bunch of hoops just to get an effect that wouldn't even be that compelling if it was offered immediately and with no hoops. That makes these actions (trap actions) generally quite awful. The best use for traps is typically to mess with monster AI, so non-loss traps do have some application, but loss traps are just a waste of an action (again, something that will be a recurring trend for this class).",
					"bottom": "The bottom is an interesting Doom, and has some value just by virtue of being a Doom, but we have a TON of Dooms at level 1 and while this is a unique effect, it's just not that powerful most of the time, and we'd rather 2 more damage per turn over this pretty much every day of the week.",

					"id": "detonation",

					"bottom": "3 pure damage is a lot on a non-loss and we hit pretty hard, making it easy enough for us to trigger this effect. And this effect can be very good against a number of different enemies types. Ranged flying enemies with low HP and high Shield tend to stand next to each other, meaning if we kill one, we can almost kill all of them. And then this will also be good against high-number swarming enemies like Sneks and Vermling.",
					"overall": "Detonation is still an interesting card though because of the Doom on bottom. We have two Doom actions which are our 'good ones' that we'll want to use every rest cycle and have up as much as possible (Race to the Grave and Rain of Arrows) but beyond that, we normally want to have access to 3-4 total Dooms in order to guarantee we can always Attack enemies with Dooms up. Thus, the very nature of being a Doom to begin with does make an action interesting. It didn't for the above Crippling Noose because we knew we had some others like this coming."
				},
				{
					"id": "farpain",
					"top": "This is our first payoff for having a doomed enemy. We should always have a doomed enemy up and so this becomes an Attack 3, Range 5. The strength is not great, the Range 5 is nice, but notice the two enhancement dots on the top so we can improve this card to keep it relevant as we level up.",
					"bottom": "And yeah, the bottom Doom here isn't good - it doesn't directly affect the Attack and has an extremely situational effect afterwards, which is very hard to have do anything meaningful.",
					"overall": "The fact that this is a non-loss attack is good enough for us at level 1, but it's only very average overall."

					"top": "Melee summons are typically quite bad in Gloomhaven unless they have some powerful unique features. Why? They tend to just suicide a lot, running into AoEs, avoidable enemy Attacks, Shield/Retaliate, etc. There's really nothing unique or powerful about this summon, so it's a hard pass.",
					"bottom": "But again, this card is interesting for the Doom. This Doom doesn't directly affect combat, but it does provide a significant amount of free movement (please note that as of Forgotten Circles, this movement is considered a Teleport and is not affected by Immobilize, contrary to the base game FAQ). I talked in the intro about how we naturally play in combat - making a big Move and then some turns not moving. We have to Move to get into range to Attack, but we have to Doom in order to make our Attacks good, which gives this natural cadence of alternating Move turns and non-Move turns. Felling Swoop bottom gives us some valuable action efficiency by squishing those two turns into one, with a Doom that will put us in range of our next enemy once we kill the first enemy, allowing us to go straight from Doom turn to Doom turn without a Move turn in between, giving us a tempo boost. Thus, this is a very solid Doom, even if it doesn't look like much at first glance. Also note that Dooms don't have Range or line-of-sight restrictions, which means you can cheese some split-up scenarios with this type of action, Dooming an enemy near your allies and letting them kill it for you.",

				{
					"id": "footsnare",

Still, sometimes if a melee enemy manages to get on top of us, we can go early with a top Attack and use this bottom to effectively CC that enemy, which isn't the worst ever.",

					"id": "freshkill",
					"top": "This is a solid non-loss Attack, which will most regularly be an Attack 5, Range 4 without needing any help. Throw a Doom on top, and you're already at Attack 6, which is stellar. That being said, this Attack will more often be made without a Doom than with one, as this is typically going to be our opener when entering a new room, and we will play this after moving, meaning no Doom right away. Still, it fills that roll just fine and obviously we can't complain about 'just' getting Attack 4. It does get worse if you have allies who spread small amounts of damage, but most of the time you can coordinate with them. ",
					"bottom": "The bottom is less exciting as a Move 3, Jump isn't anything special and we do generally prefer bigger Moves, but it is our only level 1 Jump and sometimes it will just be necessary for traversing the map, so we're happy to have it there when we need to, alongside a top Attack we'll use basically every rest cycle.",

				{

At the same time, we have multiple non-loss Attacks for 4 at level 1, so you have to be sure that the extra 4 Attack will make a significant difference, or again it's just better to rest early and get your non-losses back.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom Doom is also okay, although its power level is much more party-dependent. If you have a 4p party with attacking allies or you have allies with summons, then you'll typically find this Doom to be quite good. If you're in a 2p party or a 3p party with an ally that basically never attacks, then it will be much worse than Detonation and Felling Swoop. It should typically be pretty obvious just how good this Doom is based on your party and you should use it or not use it accordingly.",
					"overall": "Multi-Pronged Assault is a perfectly serviceable card.<p>Finally, this card gives us our first good early initiative, which is also welcome, even if we'll have a couple others.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "racetothegrave",
					"top": "The top loss isn't great. We have multiple Attack 4, Range 4's at level 1, playing a loss to get +2 Attack, +1 Range is miserable, even with 12 cards. This loss basically reads 'gain 2 XP if you kept this card until the last room' and nothing more. ",
					"bottom": "But the real draw of this card is the amazing bottom. Two direct damage per turn is pretty insane! This allows us to very, very easily kill some of the most annoying enemies in the game like Flame Demons and Vermling Shaman (and because the Doom has no range or line-of-sight limitations, you can always get it on the highest-priority target). Beyond enemies it's good against, it's also still just 2 extra damage per turn on something that counts as a Doom, so unless we're making multiple Attacks per turn, it's just as good as Rain of Arrows, our other best Doom, with the upside of also sometimes destroying high-shield enemies.",
					"overall": "Mmm... Race to the Grave, one of our two primary Dooms.<p>Another excellent point in this card's favour is the fact that the Doom triggers without attacking, which makes it a perfect Doom to play on the turn you setup Expose and similar cards where you don't get to Attack for the turn (or on the turn your ally opens a door, this way even if you can't get in to Attack, you're already doing damage and you have your Doom ready on a target for your Attack next turn). That way, even if it's not great damage for the turn, you're still doing something.</p>Finally, this card has excellent initiative, which pairs well with an effect that you want to apply before an enemy acts for the turn. Overall, just a great card, even if the top is poor. Sometimes one excellent half is all it takes.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "rainofarrows",
					"top": "So the top represents 8 Attack for a loss, which is the same value offered on Multi-Pronged Assault, only this is a lot worse. Why? Well, typically you're going to play a loss when you need a tempo boost immediately or a persistent loss that benefits you all scenario. This is somewhere in between - it doesn't really have an immediate tempo effect, but it also doesn't provide enough value over the course of a scenario to compare with good persistent losses like Expose. In the end, you're getting the same Attack as an instant loss, while this also has a condition attached. Overall, that just makes this too expensive for too poor of an effect",
					"bottom": "Furthermore, the biggest reason to not want to play the top loss is we never, ever want to lose this bottom. This Doom is our other core Doom, as obviously adding +2 Attack to all of our Attacks is something we'd want as a damage-dealing class. Take this card for the Doom and play it as often as possible.",

That being said, this is a lot of direct damage at level 1, so maybe it's decent against some enemy types? Kind of... The problem is that we already have a couple cards that are much, much easier to use against those enemies (Race to the Grave and Detonation), which work with what we normally want to do anyway, don't require us putting ourselves in an awkward position where a lot can go wrong, and aren't losses.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, this Doom is extremely underwhelming - we just don't take that much damage and we already have really free healing on A Moment's Peace.

I do still think people overrate this loss, although in this case, I don't mean that to say this loss is bad. This loss is good, quite good in fact. It combines very well with certain items and it can have a significant impact on making some rooms much, much easier. So with all of that said, why aren't we taking this card? A few reasons:<ol><li>losses scale poorly in Gloomhaven, both with levels and with difficulty. When you're against level 3 enemies, this loss looks exceptional. When you're against level 5 enemies, this loss looks fine. When you're against level 7 enemies, this loss looks mediocre.</iL<li>This loss doesn't fix any of our problems. This is actually the biggest reason we're not taking Darkened Skies. At level 3, we have 3-4 good non-loss Attacks (3 if we took Offensive at level 2). For a 12-card class, that's so bad. Solid Bow is fine as well, but that's still not close to enough non-loss Attacks relative to our hand size (and Solid Bow often needs to be a Move). We NEED, desperately, non-loss Attacks, especially good ones. We also need a good movement action, as our only currently good one is on the other half of an Attack we have to use. So while Darkened Skies provides this cool, powerful effect that would certainly be welcome, it doesn't give us anything we really need.</li><li>It's just not good on some scenarios. Some scenarios will have exclusively high-hp enemies, or high-shield medium/low hp enemies, and it's pretty useless in those scenarios, especially when combined with higher levels/difficulty.</li></ol>"

Well, first of all, we don't care THAT much about effects that benefit our allies Attacks on the same target we're attacking - we hit so hard, that enemies don't live that long. Secondly, it's still significantly less damage per round than our two good level 1 Dooms (unless we have a lot of people all attacking the same target, like a boss fight, where this is actually quite good) and less utility than the other Dooms, so it's kind of in an awkward in-between.",

The best example of an enemy where this shines is Stone Golems, which are pretty slow, non-threatening if they're far away, and extremely tanky. Earth Demons can also be another example.

Thus, by now, this sort of effect can generate a good amount of value, both through our Attacks and our allies', and it would replace Detonation/Felling Swoop as our third Doom, which are both situational by now, with something that's pretty much always good.

What makes this summon good? One word: range. Summons that attack from range typically don't suicide and tend to provide consistent damage for the duration of combat. Because this summon has 3 movement, it can easily make it from room to room without falling behind. Because it has 7 hp, it can even survive a random, unexpected ranged attack most of the time. And with 3 Attack and Poison, this is easily adding at least 4 damage per round (more likely 5-6 with your modifier deck and Poison benefiting allies as well), which is just awesome.</p>",

					"This build starts off playing multiple loss cards to project power, but as it progresses we play fewer and have more repeatable actions. This has te benefit of delaying the time that we need to play the top of Reviving Ether.",
					"The ocre of this build is the Cold Fire card we gain at level 3 which is a fairly strong attack, but with the added bonus of <i>Stun</i>, which is an overpowered status effect. At level 3 we can't fully use it as we don't have the element generation to power it up efficiently, but we will pickcards as we level up to change that."
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Once we have Cold Fire powered up it is an extremely powerfull effect that is effective against all types of creatures, and especially good against summoners with it's <i>Stun</i> effect.",
					"One thing to note is that there are some anti-synergies with some characters such as the Mindthief that also wants <i>Ice</i> and the Red Guard if they are using the Shield Spikes buyild which wants enemies to attack. The Red Guard can be worked around by targetting outlying enemies and by the end of the room when everything is surrounding the tank then only consuming <i>Fire</i>."

				"preferences": [

					"id": "aidfromtheether",
					"top": "The top provides an otherwise damage-focused class the ability to do a bit of healing. That's really perfect - in general, in Gloomhaven, focusing too much on healing will lead to weakening your character, but it's always good to have a bit of healing in most scenarios (the exception to this would be one-room scenarios where you're constantly fighting). Healing is typically not worth doing while in combat as enemy damage will outpace healing and thus you'd be better off killing or disabling enemies. But in between rooms/fights, people will usually be missing some hp and being able to restore some of that before the next fight will lead to losing less cards to negate damage over the course of the scenario, increasing longevity and allowing players to play more losses and thus be more effective. Healing in those situations is perfect with a top action because you'll often spend 1-2 turns moving towards the next door/setting up before you go in, in which case you can move toward the door or grab coins and top up your party.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom provides a very nice summon for a level 1 card. Melee summons in Gloomhaven tend to be mostly quite bad because their AI lends itself to them committing suicide quite frequently, but ranged summons don't suffer from nearly as many problems, and while the 2 range on this summon can be a bit limiting, 3 attack per round plus <i>Pierce</i> is a lot of damage, easily allowing this to be your loss that provides the most damage-per-card in many scenarios at early levels.<p>You'll especially find this useful on many boss fights, scenarios where the Spellweaver is typically weaker, assuming you can keep it alive. Whether you can keep it alive or not, in general, will determine how good this summon will be in your party. A strong, tanky front-line is best, but otherwise something like the Cragheart's obstacles or even just the Mindthief's CC can also go a long way.</p>",
					"overall": "This is a useful card with its utility healing and baby summons.<p>Enhancing the summon attack range and movement can give a lot of added value to a scenario</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "cracklingair",
					"top": "The top will be a loss for 4 attack, which is obviously terrible, unless you have Wind.<p>You cannot produce Wind yourself to buff this card in a way that actually works (the 'combo' with Ride the Wind is far, far too costly for the effect and is also really awkward to execute) but you can get it from your party-members. If you have a Brute in your party, who can create Air with the bottom of Leaping Cleave for you, you should bring this card at level 1, as in that case you'll be able to set it up before the last room and get 8 attack from a loss, which is much better. If you don't have an ally that produces Wind, you should never consider using this card.</p>",
					"bottom": "The bottom is just a move 3 with 25 initiative, which is okay but nothing special. The Retaliate line may as well not even be there as you're an extremely squishy ranged character and you should never be taking advantage of personal melee Retaliate.",

				},
				{
					"id": "fireorbs",
					"top": "The top of this card feels very good to play in a level 1 party, providing 9+ attack pretty much every time, and giving you a nice chunk of experience.<p>Because of your loss-recovery class mechanic (which we'll see later on Reviving Ether), you can more freely spend losses than many other classes, which means you'll almost always find yourself wanting to use this top in the first room to help your party with a difficult fight, and that's perfectly fine.</p>",
					"bottom": "For anytime that you don't use it right away, it has an acceptable move 3 on the bottom, which will still allow you to get something out of it while you wait for the opportunity to fire off some orbs.",
					"overall": "Fire Orbs is your signature attack at level 1.<p>The addition of <i>Wound</i> on the attacks adds some lengevity as losses which only generate damage scale poorly with levels, at higher levels it is best used againg high shield, low health enemies but that is absolutely fine.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "flamestrike",
					"top": "The top is your default highest damage non-loss attack although it comes with only 2 range, which is quite a bit more difficult to work around. The additional upside is that you can use the Fire you create with Fire Orbs to add Wound, netting 4-5 damage off of this attack, which is great. Otherwise, just being able to get a 3 whenever you really need it, rather than needing to worry about having random elements, helps quite a lot.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom action is your only bottom attack, which is also quite welcome. Other than the bottom of Mana Bolt, most of your non-loss bottom actions will just be moves, and it's nice to have something to do when you don't need to move.<p>The range 2 on the bottom is more limiting than the top (as you can't first move to get into range that round), which means you'll either need to go early in the round (earlier than 36 initiative, which is one problem with this card) by combining it with Mana Bolt or Frost Armor, in order to kill something before it goes, or you'll need to have someone else in your party protecting you.</p>",

				},
				{
					"id": "freezingnova",
					"top": "The top action is inherently powerful, it's just not worth it for us. There is traditionally a strategy for classes like ours to use actions like this, which involves using our other card to run in very late, performing this action, and then running out very early the next round. The problem is that we only have a single very early card, Mana Bolt, and it already has an enormous amount of work to do, so we'd be hurting ourselves a lot to have to use it as a move 2 exclusively with this card's combo.",
					"bottom": "Finally, the bottom action on this card just provides laughable value for a level 1 loss card - Heal 4 isn't remotely tempting us into playing this loss. Thus, with a bad top (for us, it would be great for someone like a Brute) and an even worse bottom, this card goes straight into the junk heap.",
					"overall": "After some really nice cards, multiple with good tops and bottoms, we get to our first card that has no good actions on either half. The Spellweaver has a small health pool and a tiny hand size, making her easily one of the squishiest characters in the game. Accordingly, making melee attacks is just not a good plan if we want to consistently complete scenarios."
				},
				{
					"id": "frostarmor",
					"top": "The top attack here will usually be an attack 2 at level 1 but gets to be an attack 3 that generates 1 xp more and more often as we progress in the campaign (and depending on our party composition). That's not very good but is the best we can do until later so we just have to accept it.",
					"bottom": "The bottom loss is also not very good, we'll rarely use it (most often just with Reviving Ether to get another card back to hand - more on this later) but there will occasionally be situations where it can be useful: if you know you'll have to take damage and end up losing cards anyway because of your small hp pool, might as well lose 1 card to negate two sources of damage. Still, it's more like you should look at the bottom as an emergency button rather than something you expressly try to play around.",
					"overall": "Frost Armor is far from exciting but is ultimately just 'fine'.<p>The biggest reason this card remains relevant for a while is simply the initiative: 20 is the second-best initiative we'll get until level 9, and we often need to go fast. Accordingly, the third mode for this card, which will be used often enough, is simply a move 2 with 20 initiative. Between having two slightly below-average modes and one highly situational mode, this card does enough to earn its place for a bit. Furthermore, Mana Bolt has such a good bottom (whether heal or move 2) that having this around for the top makes it easier to use Mana Bolt's bottom.</p>"

				{

					"top": "The top can theoretically be an attack 12, as opposed to Fire Orb's 9, but that's not consistently realistic as it both requires us to get into melee range of an enemy and have 4 enemies all adjacent to each other. Still, we'll regularly be able to get attack 9 from this, like Fire Orbs, just not always on the three targets we want to hit the most, rather just the targets that we can hit. The greater difficulty of effective targeting is what makes this top action weaker than Fire Orbs (as well as creating an element we care much less about).",

					"top": "The top of Reviving Ether is actually one of the single most powerful actions for any class at any level in the entire game. Gloomhaven is balanced around your hand size diminishing as you progress through a scenario and this card can single-handedly dominate that mechanic. That being said, the counterpoint for you is that your maximum hand size is 8, so this action is more of a necessity baked into the design of this class. This design allows for you to use your loss actions twice per scenario instead of once, freeing you up to play them more liberally, which is both fun and powerful. Sadly, that aspect of this class ends up abandoned (assuming you choose to play optimally) as you level, as you'll replace your splashy loss actions with just straight-up better non-loss actions.<p>You'll also need to be very careful with your positioning when you get down to 2-3 cards in your hand to make sure you can actually get the top action here off and not be forced to lose a card and thus probably lose the scenario. The Dark generation on the top is mostly irrelevant but can occasionally be used by the top of Frost Armor or Mana Bolt.</p>",
					"bottom": "The bottom of this card is great because it's a move 4 with Jump, which is a very nice action and one you'll be happy to play the entire scenario while you wait to need the top.",
					"overall": "This is the class defining card for Spellweaver an your deck throughout the game.<p>There is one other trick worth mentioning with this card which is the ability to get back a lost card that you play the turn you play the top action. The most common candidates will be Frost Armor and Aid from the Ether (and later Cold Fire). By first playing a loss and then immediately recovering it the turn you play Reviving Ether's top, you'll end up with 7 cards in your hand instead of 6. That won't add an additional turn in terms of longevity but it will give you more options. Should you choose to keep Reviving Ether's summon active and do the trick with something like the bottom of Frost Armor, it will indeed add an additional turn, as you'll have 6 cards instead of 5, thus it is something worth paying attention to.</p>"

Healing scales quite poorly but fortunately we won't want this card forever anyway and it can be quite good in the meantime. So when is Elemental Aid good? Well, first of all, you need a Cragheart. Even in a 2p party with a Cragheart, I still wouldn't take it because healing just isn't very good in 2p (and the Cragheart already has enough). So I'd say in any party involving a Cragheart and being at least 3p, Elemental Aid can be the choice at this level.",
					"bottom": "The bottom of Elemental Aid seems like it could be quite powerful but unfortunately your initiative issues mean that it's very, very difficult to get it to actually work (as Shield is only useful if you go before the enemies). You can only really use it paired with the top of Mana Bolt but as you level, you want less and less to actually use the top of Mana Bolt, thus the bottom action will routinely disappoint, despite looking quite awesome.",

Well, you see, we're never using Cold Fire before level 5 anyway (short of a fortunate early enhancement or a Mindthief in your party) so if we don't take it at level 3, we can still take it at level 4. And fortunately for us, the Spellweaver's level 4 options are pretty mediocre, thus the choice of Aid is more over the level 4 cards than over Cold Fire.</p>"

'Flame on' may also be accepted.<p>Inferno also has good initiative for us, giving us a powerful effect but not requiring us to compromise our initiative, which is already shaky.</p><p>One last thing with Inferno: no matter what weapon you had before, sell it and buy a Warhammer. Warhammer is generally a pretty bad item but Inferno actually counts as a melee attack. Yeah, that's right, you can use the Warhammer to literally Stun every enemy in the room. It's pretty good.</p>"

Otherwise, remember that this loss is just 2 attack higher than our standard attacks, which does not merit an early or mid-scenario loss on power level alone. It can get up to +4 attack with Smoke Bomb, which is a combo we'll try to use on boss fights, but we can never afford two losses outside of those scenarios.</p>"

Great movement and very low initiative.<p>Obviously if you can't consistently get the adjacency bonus, this card's top action gets a lot worse, but again you really don't want to play Scoundrel without being able to get adjacency bonuses most of the time, so I don't think that's a serious consideration we need to make.</p>"

					"overall": "The best thing to do with this card is use the top action alongside the bottom of Thief's Knack to do a combined 5 attack with 2 move in one turn. Obviously that's a lot worse than when we just use one of our attack 5's and get to use a bottom action on top of that but the advantage of this Quick Hands combo is that we don't require allied adjacency on our target, which even in a party with a melee ally, can't always be the case (although in most of those cases, that's when we use our ranged attacks, both because they're more flexible and because it's riskier to approach enemies when we're alone)."
				},
				{
					"id": "singleout",
					"top": "Single Out is the same top action as Flanking Strike but worse because of initiative (at least intrinsically) and the bottom action. So there's not a lot to say about the top action, obviously, as it was great on Flanking Strike and it's great here.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, you'll again pretty rarely play. The same rule applies regarding average scenarios, but here even on boss scenarios, it's much more questionable because it's harder to use (you need to be sure, usually in advance, that the boss will start and remain isolated for this bottom action to really be worth the loss).",
					"overall": "While intrinsically the late initiative might seem bad, having at least one really late initiative is actually very helpful for the Scoundrel, allowing for the classic 'run in late, attack, go early the next around with an attack and move out or finish the enemy.' So even what's 'bad' on this card is often good, making it another very good card."
				},
				{
					"id": "sinisteropportunity",
					"top": "The strength of this top action largely depends on your party size and to some extent your party composition. First of all, let's establish that you cannot consistently create Dark without enhancement (the Dark enhancement strategy for the Scoundrel is an interesting idea though, to be sure), you only have Smoke Bomb. And we're only using the Smoke Bomb loss on short/boss scenarios, so on those scenarios can this be a better replacement for Backstab when doing a Smoke Bomb combo? If you're in a party of 4, probably. Obviously if you're in a party of 4 and have at least 2 melee allies, then the answer is definitely. Party of 4 with 1 melee ally is close and really ends up being a judgment call based on how much your ranged allies are willing to work with you (can you get at least one of them to move into melee range). If you can get 2 allies in melee range, then this card is obviously better for the combo than Backstab, if you can't, then stick with Backstab.<p>So it's worthwhile to bring for Smoke Bomb combo scenarios in parties of 4 with 1-2 melee allies. Is it worthwhile for anything other than that? Well, in a 2 player party, never. Obviously the top action can never be good in such a party. Otherwise, if you have an ally who can consistently create Dark, I would absolutely bring this card in a party of 3 or larger. If you don't, I wouldn't, because even in a party of 4, you'd need at least 2 allies next to a target for this even to be an attack 5. And while an attack 5 is good, having 2 allies next to a target and that target not already being dead (obviously excluding bosses, which we addressed above) is quite rare and will usually be far from optimal.</p>",
					"bottom": "Now, after all this discussion of the top action, how is the bottom? It's fine. A move 3 is obviously on the short end for this class but still on the general scale of actions, a move 3 with a small upside is a nice action. How important is this small upside? Again, it depends on your party composition - if you have someone like a Brute as a melee ally, who typically can't go as early as you, you may need this action in order to setup adjacency some amount of the time. If you have a melee ally like a Mindthief, you'll need this very, very rarely. Finally, if your party completely lacks Push, this action can sometimes work to trigger traps, at least until you get level 7, which gives you much more flexibility in that department.",

					"top": "The top action is not good on an average scenario as you simply cannot afford loss cards that do something like 5-7 attack (potentially even requiring another loss) with a 9 card hand size.

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom depends on party composition: if your melee ally is a Mindthief, this action will be pretty unnecessary as the Mindthief can approach enemies at similar initiatives to you without a problem.<p>If your melee ally is a Brute, this action will actually be quite good as you can reposition enemies next to the Brute before the Brute goes, which is an issue for him as he can rarely go as early as you in the round. If you have no melee allies this action is also quite good but I wouldn't recommend that situation in general.</p>",

					"overall": "Special Mixture is a very nice card and is consistently quite underrated.<p>Obviously, if you have something like a Tinkerer in your party, whose primary job is healing, the top of this card becomes a lot less necessary and thus we're less inclined to bring it for just one half.</p>"

					"overall": "Thief's Knack has two good, if somewhat situation sides.<p>The downside for you is that you don't typically want to spend a turn next to an enemy in order to be able to use this action the following turn. That leaves two common situations in which this attack is good:<ol><li>with the top action of Quick Hands (and later the level 3 card) which allows you to move in and still get the bottom.</li><li>it's quite common for melee classes to try to go as late as possible in order to allow enemies to act without reaching them (assuming the enemies don't have enough movement or range to do so - this strategy falls apart significantly as you get to the higher levels when enemies have way too much movement or range to avoid) and then walk in late with an attack, followed by a very early action the following round.</li></lo><p>Typically when the Scoundrel does this routine it's part of an in-and-out dance where you run back outside of the reach of monsters the following turn, but sometimes you'll just need a little extra damage to finish an enemy off, so you can play a top and bottom attack early the next round, using the bottom of Thief's Knack, and get in for something like 8 damage to eliminate an enemy (and thus you may not need to run away as an attacker should be gone). Obviously the risk with this strategy is that you're extremely exposed should you flip a miss.</p>"

For turns where you don't want to or aren't sure that you can get next to enemies with a melee ally, you can toss some knives and barely miss out on any damage (4 vs 5, but obviously scales better with your modifier deck). The only downside is that your job will typically be eliminating enemies before they go and instead spreading a smaller amount of damage around on multiple targets won't always feel great as you may be leaving all the enemy attackers around.",

The problem is that you can only use this action when you're already in range for an attack, which means primarily with ranged attacks or if you ended your turn in melee range of an enemy (but in the case of the latter, you'll generally prefer to use Thief's Knack to help finish an enemy).",

					"bottom": "When you don't need the top attack (which will be more often than not, ideally), you've just got a casual move 5 on the bottom.",
					"overall": "Venom Shiv is a fine-but-not-exciting card.<p>The biggest downside of this card is the initiative, which is not good. While having 1-2 very late initiatives can be very good, 60 is late without being late enough to actually be good.</p>"

					"top": "So the top Attack is in the same vein as Flanking Strike and Single Out and is, in fact, a minimum of an Attack 5 just like they are, with the possibility of being an Attack 6 a significant portion of the time. The only small downside is that Wound doesn't stack so if your party already has multiple other sources of Wound, you need to be more careful where you attack or this may just end up as an Attack 4. The other great thing about this top Attack is that not getting the Wound isn't the end of the world, making this one of our best attacks to use when we can't get allied-adjacency that turn.<p>At level 1, an Attack 3 in melee is pretty bad. At level 2, an Attack 4 in melee isn't good, but it's acceptable, so you have a lot of flexibility with when and how you play this top action.</p>",
					"bottom": "The flexibility is only improved by the fact that this can be a Move 5 when you absolutely need it to be (although it's more likely that you'll want to avoid that most of the time until much higher level as this is currently your best non-loss Attack).",

It also helps a lot with looting in combination with Swift Bow, allowing you to position yourself for an ideal path before you use the bottom of Swift Bow to Loot. Finally, its top action also combos with Thief's Knack just like Quick Hands did, although obviously now with one more Attack. Still, while this combo was fine, you'll never really be that excited to do that rather than a more powerful top Attack.</p>",
					"bottom": "Fortunately, where Duelist's Advance scales better into higher levels is the bottom action, which is what you'll want to use most in combat. Having a couple non-Move bottom actions that are effective in combat is always welcome and this one can, often, add at least 2 Attack. The upside is quite high, however, as you'll sometimes be able to combine this with Throwing Knives or Flurry of Blades (at level 4) to add 2-6 Attack, which feels great.",

					"bottom": "The bottom action of Invisibility is powerful but for a level 3 is also pretty unimpressive (the Mindthief gets the same action at level 1 with better initiative). Also, Invisibility on a non-Move bottom action is often difficult to use effectively because you cannot move to set yourself up ideally. Obviously you could do that with Quick Hands or Duelist's Advance, but the former is a poor card to have as we level and the latter is the other choice from level 3 (and there's no world in which we're skipping the level 4 or 5 cards to go back for one of these). Also, you're still just doing an Attack 3 at best for a turn there, which is mediocre.",
					"overall": "This is quite a bad card.<p>The base attack is less damage than Fire Orbs for the Spellweaver at level 1 and this is level 3. We're also a class that can less afford loss actions and we've already seen that our cards typically compare favourably in terms of power level to the Spellweaver simply because we have less longevity.</p>"

You'll just love this card because you're always happy to use one of the halves. The only frustration comes from the fact that when you use one half, you can't use the other.</p>"

					"overall": "Well, this card is supposed to be a strict upgrade over Backstab but in reality it's not so clear-cut. One of Backstab's best-selling points is its initiative and Gruesome Advantage has terrible initiative.<p>The small added bonus of the top's upgrade may not even make this card better than Backstab and we're definitely not in on taking a side-grade at level 4 (especially against as good of a card as Flurry of Blades).</p>"

					"bottom": "Fortunately, for all the time you struggle or simply can't use the top effectively, this card also provides a very worthwhile bottom action. Admittedly, it's not really even better than Special Mixture because you're not an AoE class in melee range and you don't have crowd control, so you don't really want to put yourself next to 2-3 enemies most of the time and two movement is a lot worse than three.",

Even if this bottom didn't have the conditional requirement on it, it would just be a playable loss, not even too strong, and obviously the conditional requirement is a huge downside.",

					"overall": "Burning Oil is just a nice card. Having a mixture of ranged and melee attacks allows you to make sure you're always dealing effective damage while also avoiding enemy damage.<p>The super-late initiative on this card is also really incredible actually, as those turns when you let the enemies go before you and then move in can be even more flexible (given that you don't always know if the enemies will move or how much) when you can make a powerful ranged attack.</p>"
				},

There may also be an interesting strategy with this class once you reach Prosperity 6 or 7 where you enhance at least 1 source of Dark on one of your moves in order to make this a self-contained combo but I've never tried that out.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom of this action is interesting but not super useful. You don't actually have any benefit to being Invisible other than what it does innately but at the same time, that's also not very useful for you. Your attacks are either ranged or require an ally adjacent to your target and in either case, Invisibility just isn't going to do much most of the time (other than redirect damage to an ally, but that's a lot worse than getting Advantage or adding Poison).",

Obviously the bottom here + Smoke Bomb requires a fair amount of setup but the payoff is really there.

					"overall": "Spring the Trap is both hilariously-awesome and the ultimate sideboard card.<p>So the real question is: should we take a card that we know is strictly a sideboard card? In this case, I think the upside is high enough that the answer is yes. In either situation when we bring this card in, it's going to have a very strong impact on our ability to win the scenario. And enough scenarios will either be boss fights or have a reasonable number (4+) of traps that you should still use this more often than not.</p>"

				},
				{
					"id": "watchitburn",
					"top": "Watch it Burn is powerful enough to easily merit playing a persistent loss on a 9-card class, as the added tempo is easily going to outweigh the cost of playing as an 8-card class in boss fights.",
					"bottom": "On long scenarios where we really just can't afford it, the Move 5 with a very powerful effect at an amazing late initiative (something we always appreciate, even more now that we have repeatable Invisibility as we often want to come out of Invisibility late in the round so enemies will have acted before us) will also be great.",
					"overall": "Obviously the build is to take this card along with all your multiple-target knife attacks and just spread Wound and Poison everywhere. If this card was an option at level 8, that might be a real build, but sadly it is not because taking this card at level 9 would mean not taking Long Con, which is an absurd card."

					"bottom": "There's also a TON of text on the bottom but you really don't even need to read it.",
					"overall": "We add Jump to the bottom of Flurry specifically for this combo: Jump into the centre of most of the enemies, Disarm them all and remove a significant portion of their hp, Stamina Potion them both back, repeat next turn, and now the room is over. Monsters trying to fight against this card is like an old hermit throwing rocks at the Death Star to try to save his world - it's just not happening and it ends with destruction. You even have initiative 2 in order to make sure you always get this off before enemies go. Honestly, this action is completely broken and is one of the two most absurd cards in all the starting classes (alongside Inferno). If scenarios aren't easy for you after you pick this up, you're doing something wrong.,p>Finally, if you ever wondered how good the Scoundrel is at looting, how about you do that math on a beautiful Curse enhancement there quickly and then come back to gape in awe (I would absolutely recommend that Curse enhancement if you can ever afford it, it is also completely broken).</p>"

					"overall": "You bring this card to scenarios for the bottom action, which is very good, and then if you lose it before the end to a short rest roll, it's really not a big deal.<p>If you do manage to keep it until the end (which shouldn't be a priority but can just sometimes happen), then sometimes you'll get to play the top loss in the last couple of turns, when playing a loss has a minimal impact on longevity. Otherwise, remember that this loss is just 2 attack higher than our standard attacks, which does not merit an early or mid-scenario loss on power level alone. It can get up to +4 attack with Smoke Bomb, which is a combo we'll try to use on boss fights, but we can never afford two losses outside of those scenarios.</p>"

					"overall": "This is our best level 1 card. Great movement and very low initiative.<p>Obviously if you can't consistently get the adjacency bonus, this card's top action gets a lot worse, but again you really don't want to play Scoundrel without being able to get adjacency bonuses most of the time, so I don't think that's a serious consideration we need to make.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "quickhands",
					"top": "The move is nice on the top, but the attack in general is underwhelming.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also not very good as bottom Loot actions typically remain.",
					"overall": "The best thing to do with this card is use the top action alongside the bottom of Thief's Knack to do a combined 5 attack with 2 move in one turn. Obviously that's a lot worse than when we just use one of our attack 5's and get to use a bottom action on top of that but the advantage of this Quick Hands combo is that we don't require allied adjacency on our target, which even in a party with a melee ally, can't always be the case (although in most of those cases, that's when we use our ranged attacks, both because they're more flexible and because it's riskier to approach enemies when we're alone)."
				},
				{
					"id": "singleout",
					"top": "Single Out is the same top action as Flanking Strike but worse because of initiative (at least intrinsically) and the bottom action. So there's not a lot to say about the top action, obviously, as it was great on Flanking Strike and it's great here.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, you'll again pretty rarely play. The same rule applies regarding average scenarios, but here even on boss scenarios, it's much more questionable because it's harder to use (you need to be sure, usually in advance, that the boss will start and remain isolated for this bottom action to really be worth the loss).",
					"overall": "While intrinsically the late initiative might seem bad, having at least one really late initiative is actually very helpful for the Scoundrel, allowing for the classic 'run in late, attack, go early the next around with an attack and move out or finish the enemy.' So even what's 'bad' on this card is often good, making it another very good card."
				},
				{
					"id": "sinisteropportunity",
					"top": "The strength of this top action largely depends on your party size and to some extent your party composition. First of all, let's establish that you cannot consistently create Dark without enhancement (the Dark enhancement strategy for the Scoundrel is an interesting idea though, to be sure), you only have Smoke Bomb. And we're only using the Smoke Bomb loss on short/boss scenarios, so on those scenarios can this be a better replacement for Backstab when doing a Smoke Bomb combo? If you're in a party of 4, probably. Obviously if you're in a party of 4 and have at least 2 melee allies, then the answer is definitely. Party of 4 with 1 melee ally is close and really ends up being a judgment call based on how much your ranged allies are willing to work with you (can you get at least one of them to move into melee range). If you can get 2 allies in melee range, then this card is obviously better for the combo than Backstab, if you can't, then stick with Backstab.<p>So it's worthwhile to bring for Smoke Bomb combo scenarios in parties of 4 with 1-2 melee allies. Is it worthwhile for anything other than that? Well, in a 2 player party, never. Obviously the top action can never be good in such a party. Otherwise, if you have an ally who can consistently create Dark, I would absolutely bring this card in a party of 3 or larger. If you don't, I wouldn't, because even in a party of 4, you'd need at least 2 allies next to a target for this even to be an attack 5. And while an attack 5 is good, having 2 allies next to a target and that target not already being dead (obviously excluding bosses, which we addressed above) is quite rare and will usually be far from optimal.</p>",
					"bottom": "Now, after all this discussion of the top action, how is the bottom? It's fine. A move 3 is obviously on the short end for this class but still on the general scale of actions, a move 3 with a small upside is a nice action. How important is this small upside? Again, it depends on your party composition - if you have someone like a Brute as a melee ally, who typically can't go as early as you, you may need this action in order to setup adjacency some amount of the time. If you have a melee ally like a Mindthief, you'll need this very, very rarely. Finally, if your party completely lacks Push, this action can sometimes work to trigger traps, at least until you get level 7, which gives you much more flexibility in that department.",
					"overall": "Sinister Opportunity isn't a bad card but it's also not exceptional as it gives us a very late initiative option."
				},
				{
					"id": "smokebomb",
					"top": "The top action is not good on an average scenario as you simply cannot afford loss cards that do something like 5-7 attack (potentially even requiring another loss) with a 9 card hand size. On short/boss scenarios, the top is very good and you should usually always bring it for that alone.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom depends on party composition: if your melee ally is a Mindthief, this action will be pretty unnecessary as the Mindthief can approach enemies at similar initiatives to you without a problem.<p>If your melee ally is a Brute, this action will actually be quite good as you can reposition enemies next to the Brute before the Brute goes, which is an issue for him as he can rarely go as early as you in the round. If you have no melee allies this action is also quite good but I wouldn't recommend that situation in general.</p>",
					"overall": "This is a very situational card and depends on both the scenario and party composition.<p>It comes into it's own at level 5 with a round 1 execute combo.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "specialmixture",
					"top": "And while we will never, ever use the top action in combat (which is fine because the bottom is great in combat), having some healing when moving from room to room is quite welcome, as you will certainly take some hits almost every scenario.",
					"bottom": "If you're in combat, the bottom functions a bit like a non-move bottom action, giving at least +1 damage for free, while still allowing you to move, if necessary.",
					"overall": "Special Mixture is a very nice card and is consistently quite underrated.<p>Obviously, if you have something like a Tinkerer in your party, whose primary job is healing, the top of this card becomes a lot less necessary and thus we're less inclined to bring it for just one half.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "swiftbow",
					"top": "The top attack is fine and gives flexibility in your ranged attack.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action with 3 move will often let you pick up a couple of coins and if enhanced or with boots even more.",
					"overall": "Once/if you have the Power of Enhancement, I would immediately put +1 move on the bottom of Swift Bow, which is an inexpensive enhancement and will greatly increase the effectiveness of this card. With the extra move, it's very common to be able to pick up 2 or 3 coins, meaning your enhancement investment will quickly pay for itself."
				},
				{
					"id": "thiefsknack",
					"top": "Being able to use traps as a ranged attack is a very powerful mechanic, especially against shielded enemies and archers who drop traps as an action.",
					"bottom": "The real star of this card is the bottom attack 3, 1 XP, which again compares very favourably to other classes at level 1 (the Brute has attack 2, no XP at level 1). The downside for you is that you don't typically want to spend a turn next to an enemy in order to be able to use this action the following turn.",
					"overall": "Thief's Knack has two good, if somewhat situation sides.<p>The downside for you is that you don't typically want to spend a turn next to an enemy in order to be able to use this action the following turn. That leaves two common situations in which this attack is good:<ol><li>with the top action of Quick Hands (and later the level 3 card) which allows you to move in and still get the bottom.</li><li>it's quite common for melee classes to try to go as late as possible in order to allow enemies to act without reaching them (assuming the enemies don't have enough movement or range to do so - this strategy falls apart significantly as you get to the higher levels when enemies have way too much movement or range to avoid) and then walk in late with an attack, followed by a very early action the following round.</li></lo><p>Typically when the Scoundrel does this routine it's part of an in-and-out dance where you run back outside of the reach of monsters the following turn, but sometimes you'll just need a little extra damage to finish an enemy off, so you can play a top and bottom attack early the next round, using the bottom of Thief's Knack, and get in for something like 8 damage to eliminate an enemy (and thus you may not need to run away as an attacker should be gone). Obviously the risk with this strategy is that you're extremely exposed should you flip a miss.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "throwingknives",
					"top": "First of all, how good is this top action? Very, very good for a level 1 card (for comparison, the Spellweaver gets literally the exact same top action, on a playable card, at level 4 with 20 initiative). For turns where you don't want to or aren't sure that you can get next to enemies with a melee ally, you can toss some knives and barely miss out on any damage (4 vs 5, but obviously scales better with your modifier deck). The only downside is that your job will typically be eliminating enemies before they go and instead spreading a smaller amount of damage around on multiple targets won't always feel great as you may be leaving all the enemy attackers around.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, you'll pretty much never play the bottom action of this card as it's a loss and while a Loot 2 loss is also quite powerful at level 1 (the Spellweaver gets that same action at level 3), you'll eventually have enhanced Swift Bow (or your boots) for looting most of the time and losses are too painful.",
					"overall": "Throwing Knives seems out of place as a multi-target ranged attack on a melee assassin but the Scoundrel has a knife-throwing subtheme and honestly, we're quite happy to see it because it provides some welcome flexibility.<p>If somehow this ends up being one of your last 2-3 cards at the end of a scenario (which isn't typically ideal but can happen), then you may occasionally get to fire off the bottom.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "trickstersreversal",
					"top": "The top action has the potential to be very powerful against high-shield enemies that are otherwise difficult to kill. Still, it is a loss, which means we'll basically only bring this card when facing Flame Demons or Vermling Shaman in shorter scenarios (and we should typically save it for an elite).",
					"bottom": "The bottom action is fine and you will use it sometimes when you bring this card for the top but is not enough to justify bringing the card on a regular basis by itself. The problem is that you can only use this action when you're already in range for an attack, which means primarily with ranged attacks or if you ended your turn in melee range of an enemy (but in the case of the latter, you'll generally prefer to use Thief's Knack to help finish an enemy).",
					"overall": "Trickster's Reversal is a pretty bad card that fits firmly into the sideboard card category."
				},
				{
					"id": "venomshiv",
					"top": "The top action is good for when you need to lead the way in attacking an enemy and for whatever reason can't rely on an ally to get there before you. By giving an attack 3 poison, you'll often end up doing around an attack 5 with this attack anyway as Poison should add around 2 additional attack in this situations.",
					"bottom": "When you don't need the top attack (which will be more often than not, ideally), you've just got a casual move 5 on the bottom.",
					"overall": "Venom Shiv is a fine-but-not-exciting card.<p>The biggest downside of this card is the initiative, which is not good. While having 1-2 very late initiatives can be very good, 60 is late without being late enough to actually be good.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "flintlock",
					"top": "A top Loot action is typically nice, although situational, and this is paired with a spammable bottom action.",
					"bottom": "A spammable ranged bottom action with Pierce is good for this class as she is fairly limited against shielded enemies and has low HP so retaliate enemies are also very troublesome.",
					"overall": "This is a solid card with a good late initiative and a spammable bottom that adds to our build."
				},
				{
					"id": "openwound",
					"top": "So the top Attack is in the same vein as Flanking Strike and Single Out and is, in fact, a minimum of an Attack 5 just like they are, with the possibility of being an Attack 6 a significant portion of the time. The only small downside is that Wound doesn't stack so if your party already has multiple other sources of Wound, you need to be more careful where you attack or this may just end up as an Attack 4. The other great thing about this top Attack is that not getting the Wound isn't the end of the world, making this one of our best attacks to use when we can't get allied-adjacency that turn.<p>At level 1, an Attack 3 in melee is pretty bad. At level 2, an Attack 4 in melee isn't good, but it's acceptable, so you have a lot of flexibility with when and how you play this top action.</p>",
					"bottom": "The flexibility is only improved by the fact that this can be a Move 5 when you absolutely need it to be (although it's more likely that you'll want to avoid that most of the time until much higher level as this is currently your best non-loss Attack).",
					"overall": "What's not to like about this card? Great top action, good bottom action, good initiative."
				},
				{
					"id": "duelistsadvance",
					"top": "The top action that's a strict upgrade over Quick Hands, although Quick Hands was never good.<p>It just gives us more movement for when we need to rush through a scenario, allowing us to move up to 9 spaces without items or losses in a single turn. It also helps a lot with looting in combination with Swift Bow, allowing you to position yourself for an ideal path before you use the bottom of Swift Bow to Loot. Finally, its top action also combos with Thief's Knack just like Quick Hands did, although obviously now with one more Attack. Still, while this combo was fine, you'll never really be that excited to do that rather than a more powerful top Attack.</p>",
					"bottom": "Fortunately, where Duelist's Advance scales better into higher levels is the bottom action, which is what you'll want to use most in combat. Having a couple non-Move bottom actions that are effective in combat is always welcome and this one can, often, add at least 2 Attack. The upside is quite high, however, as you'll sometimes be able to combine this with Throwing Knives or Flurry of Blades (at level 4) to add 2-6 Attack, which feels great.",
					"overall": "This is an OK card, but not something to look forward to receiving."
				},
				{
					"id": "hiddendaggers",
					"top": "This top action is quite underpowered, even with Advantage, for a loss in general and not remotely welcome for our class given it’s a loss card.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action of Invisibility is powerful but for a level 3 is also pretty unimpressive (the Mindthief gets the same action at level 1 with better initiative). Also, Invisibility on a non-Move bottom action is often difficult to use effectively because you cannot move to set yourself up ideally. Obviously you could do that with Quick Hands or Duelist's Advance, but the former is a poor card to have as we level and the latter is the other choice from level 3 (and there's no world in which we're skipping the level 4 or 5 cards to go back for one of these). Also, you're still just doing an Attack 3 at best for a turn there, which is mediocre.",
					"overall": "This is quite a bad card.<p>The base attack is less damage than Fire Orbs for the Spellweaver at level 1 and this is level 3. We're also a class that can less afford loss actions and we've already seen that our cards typically compare favourably in terms of power level to the Spellweaver simply because we have less longevity.</p>"

					"bottom": "The bottom gives a Move action that also adds a bit of non-Move bonus while in combat (Move 4 is also a very convenient number for a certain helm that this class wants) that is excellent for making your giant hits on bosses consistent.",
					"overall": "Flurry of Blades is really an incredible card.<p>Like Open Wound, it's another one of those cards that just has EVERYTHING going for it with the upgraded top and the bonus to the move on the bottom.</p>The 3 initiative is obviously just blindingly fast (in base Gloomhaven, there are only two monsters with one card each that can go faster than this). You'll just love this card because you're always happy to use one of the halves. The only frustration comes from the fact that when you use one half, you can't use the other.</p>"

					"top": "The top here offers a more powerful version of the Backstab loss, but we don't want loss cards at all.",
					"bottom": "The bottom adds one movement to Backstab.<p>Because the top loss is merely a sideboard consideration, the main comparison is the bottom vs the bottom, and I'd honestly rather have a move 6 with 6 initiative than a move 7 with 62 initiative.</p>",
					"overall": "Well, this card is supposed to be a strict upgrade over Backstab but in reality it's not so clear-cut. One of Backstab's best-selling points is its initiative and Gruesome Advantage has terrible initiative.<p>The small added bonus of the top's upgrade may not even make this card better than Backstab and we're definitely not in on taking a side-grade at level 4 (especially against as good of a card as Flurry of Blades).</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "visageoftheinevitable",
					"top": "You will use this top on the first turn of most scenarios and give your party a huge head start in the first room fight. Beyond that, it will be a bit harder to setup properly, but the payoff is absolutely worth it.",
					"bottom": "Fortunately, for all the time you struggle or simply can't use the top effectively, this card also provides a very worthwhile bottom action. Admittedly, it's not really even better than Special Mixture because you're not an AoE class in melee range and you don't have crowd control, so you don't really want to put yourself next to 2-3 enemies most of the time and two movement is a lot worse than three.",

Even if this bottom didn't have the conditional requirement on it, it would just be a playable loss, not even too strong, and obviously the conditional requirement is a huge downside.",

					"overall": "Burning Oil is just a nice card. Having a mixture of ranged and melee attacks allows you to make sure you're always dealing effective damage while also avoiding enemy damage.<p>The super-late initiative on this card is also really incredible actually, as those turns when you let the enemies go before you and then move in can be even more flexible (given that you don't always know if the enemies will move or how much) when you can make a powerful ranged attack.</p>"

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom of this action is interesting but not super useful. You don't actually have any benefit to being Invisible other than what it does innately but at the same time, that's also not very useful for you.

Obviously the bottom here + Smoke Bomb requires a fair amount of setup but the payoff is really there.

					"overall": "Obviously the build is to take this card along with all your multiple-target knife attacks and just spread Wound and Poison everywhere.

					"overall": "We add Jump to the bottom of Flurry specifically for this combo: Jump into the centre of most of the enemies, Disarm them all and remove a significant portion of their hp, Stamina Potion them both back, repeat next turn, and now the room is over. Monsters trying to fight against this card is like an old hermit throwing rocks at the Death Star to try to save his world - it's just not happening and it ends with destruction. You even have initiative 2 in order to make sure you always get this off before enemies go. Honestly, this action is completely broken and is one of the two most absurd cards in all the starting classes (alongside Inferno). If scenarios aren't easy for you after you pick this up, you're doing something wrong.,p>Finally, if you ever wondered how good the Scoundrel is at looting, how about you do that math on a beautiful Curse enhancement there quickly and then come back to gape in awe (I would absolutely recommend that Curse enhancement if you can ever afford it, it is also completely broken).</p>"

And as is the general rule, on a mostly-melee damage-dealer, we really love having two instances of big Move Jump actions, and this will be the first. And Flanking Strike top scales rather poorly, so having this bottom enhancement will pick up the slack as a perfect bottom action at any level with this initiative."
