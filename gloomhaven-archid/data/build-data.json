			"overview": { 
				"body": [
					"This Red Guard build centres around the Shield Spikes card that retaliates damage based on the Shield value at the time of the hit. This means that the build is not overly interested in the AMD or damage abilities, focussing instead on consistently increasing our shield value. We use both enhancements and items to increase this value. Because some of the decenbt shileding items are not found until higher wealth levels the build can feel a little underwhelming at the start if these have not been unlocked yet.",
					"Applying the <i>Immobilize</i> status effect is also very useful to us as it means we can lock down ranged enemies so they do not attempt to move away and we can get our retaliate to proc."
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Strong against the typically difficult high shield/retaliate enemies.",
					"Strong against swarming enemies as they tend to be low health, low damage and our shields can negate much if not all the damage, whilst dishing out direct damage back."
				],
				"preferences": [
					"Party members who can provide us with <i>Shield</i> or <i>Immobilize</i> enemies. There is a great synergy with the Sawbones persistent loss that gives a permanent shield 1, and even better with the upgraded version that allows us to ignore negative status effects. The Spellweaver, Tinkerer and Voidwarden also have cards that can help.",
					"Party members that can heal us, especially at lower levels when we have loiwer shield values.",
					"Unusually we want to be hit a lot so <i>Stun</i> is not something we want on adjacent enemies, we are happy to have them draw a <i>Curse</i> as that means they still attack."
				]

			"cards": [
				{
					"id": "bladedance",
					"top": "The top is excellent if you have the elements, but… you don’t. A top move is not very good on this build, because all our good shields are either top actions or tied to moves, so it doesn’t really add anything.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also a just okay loss, which means it’s not really viable in this build.",
					"overall": "This card demands too much from our elements to be taken in place of others."
				},
				{
					"id": "blindingsickle",
					"top": "On the top, we have an Immobilize, which is decent for locking down a ranged enemy so they have to eat our Shield Spikes. Initiative is very late, which is actually good; it means we can ensure we go after the enemies. A good sequence is to use this late initiative to immobilize an archer, then next round set up a full Shield turn to kill it.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is, again, less desirable because it’s a non-movement bottom that isn’t super useful.",
					"overall": "This is Flaming Sickle’s twin, but it’s a bit less desirable because we care about Light less than Fire.<p>Overall, this would be a card that I’d be happy to take… if there weren’t better ways to Immobilize enemies and make Light.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "desertnight",
					"top": "A great late initiative with a very consistent and powerful The top is an essentially range 2 Disarm, which is quite good. Sometimes there are enemies you really can’t put up enough Shield to deal with, so preventing them from attacking while come in clutch. The elements also help out allies like the Voidwarden or Mindthief.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is an emergency loss that will normally only be used in escape scenarios or to snag a chest from underneath a teammate.",
					"overall": "Initiative is very late, which is actually good; it means we can ensure we go after the enemies."
				},
				{
					"id": "flameshroud",
					"top": "The top is a loss that can be decent against high shield/low health enemies (and it synergizes well with our Pull abilities), but using a second loss on a 10 card hand that plans on taking lots of hits is just much too risky.",
					"bottom": "The bottom, however, is great for us. Move 4, Shield 1, initiative 6 is everything we could ask for. It lets us position to tank a hit and goes early enough to beat almost any monster. The only problem is that <i>Fire</i> will be the one element we never have enough of, but the payoff is worth it.",
					"overall": "The 6 initiative is your best and is really insanely-good initiative for this type of class. Finally, the Fire consumption is a nice bonus that often doesn't matter much because you want Fire so badly for other actions."
				},
				{
					"id": "flamingsickle",
					"top": "The top action is significant for being your only non-loss <i>Fire</i> generating top at level 1. Given that Flame Shroud needs <i>Fire</i> and is a key card for this build, that’s kind of a big deal. The pull also synergizes with your Shields, letting you ensure that monster focus remains on you.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also a <i>Fire</i> generator, which is good for the same reasons described above, but slightly less valuable because as a tank, you often need to keep moving in order to protect your teammates and/or avoid unnecessary hits.",
					"overall": "Overall, this is a card that makes it into our hand until we find a better source of Fire.<p>The initiative is very subpar; not fast, but not slow enough to reliably go after monsters.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "healingsands",
					"top": "The top is an excellent top self-heal that is great for getting back any life lost while moving between rooms (and as the team tank, you’ll be taking some damage that should be removed). It also gives an unconditional XP, which isn’t super notable given that there are many go-to cards that do the same thing.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is… okay. On average, this will essentially be a -1 to enemy attacks, meaning it’s essentially a more complicated Shield 1. That’s great… except you can’t use Shield Spikes to deal damage back.",
					"overall": "Initiative-wise, this is on the wrong side of the fast/meh border, especially compared to some of your other cards.<p>Overall, this is a card that can definitely find a place in a level 1 hand, but after that it depends on your team comp; do you have allies that can reliably heal you (think Tinkerer, Voidwarden, spoilers)? If so, you can leave this at home. Otherwise, it will be necessary to keep this around for longer than it deserves.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "precisionstrike",
					"top": "The top is a decent boss-killing loss, which is the only time you’d ever bring it.",
					"bottom": "The bottom doesn’t do enough, which, combined with its initiative, makes it just an overall lacklustre card.",
					"overall": "Precision Strike is legitimately your worst card and it's not even bad.<p>I do recommend bringing this card for the top action to boss fights at low levels, where it is good.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "shieldspikes",
					"top": "This is our core persistent loss.<p>Shield Spikes is a class-defining, build around card. Now, I know what anyone who’s done a bit of base Gloomhaven is saying; “That’s just Retaliate with extra steps, and Retaliate sucks!” To that I’d say; yes, retaliate sucks in base Gloomhaven, but that’s because most retaliate abilities in base Gloom are an either/or with putting up Shields, so you take more damage than usual to deal… an unpredictable amount back. This lets you do both at once, which is a huge improvement. Additionally, as we’ll see in a bit, you have access to a fair amount of immobilize effects, letting you trap enemies who would otherwise run away from you into taking damage from your spikes.</p>",
					"bottom": "Oh, right, there’s a bottom here; it’s a decent heal, and will always be useful for clearing poison and wound. It’s also one of your only non-loss bottom Fire generators at any level, which is why it’s somewhat worth taking along early even if you don’t want to use Shield Spikes. Obviously though, the main point of this card is the top.",
					"overall": "Shield Spikes persistent loss is the core of one of the two builds for the Red Guard and unlike some alternative builds for classes in Gloomhaven, the Shield Spikes build has everything it needs to shine.<p>Initiative is in the bad zone (mid-range is just too inconsistent, but odds are you aren’t carrying this in your hand for long enough to matter.</p>"

				{
					"id": "shieldofthedesert",
					"top": "The top is a powerful attack action at good initiative… provided we have the elements for it. As we’ve seen though, we’re starved for Fire and would prefer to use it on Flame Shroud. Light is much less of a problem to get once we take a look at the X cards, but the consumption here is also less desirable than Twirling Stabs or Shocking Advance. Forget seeing this as a double target Attack 4, more often than not this will be a single target Attack 4 that maybe triggers a trap, which is good enough for a level 1.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is an extremely powerful loss for this build; at this level, Shield 3 may as well be “take no damage this round,” but again, we’re already running a loss in Shield Spikes; the longevity cost isn’t really worth it.",
					"overall": "The initiative is extremely good, and at level 1 that’ll be the main draw of this card (we have excellent early initiatives on our “Shields up” turns, but much worse on our off turns)."
				},
				{
					"id": "shockingadvance",
					"top": "The top is one of only 2 top Shield actions we have at level 1, though it does require Light, and thus it competes with Twirling Stabs. However, the Immobilize synergizes nicely with the Shield (as described on Blinding Sickle).",
					"bottom": "The bottom is one of our best Light generators, and has an enhancement dot that looks ripe for a Fire enhancement. My first recommended enhancement would be to put a Fire on there ASAP. Having an easy way to move and make Fire will be key, and having a card that makes both your main elements nicely sets up cards like Shield of the Desert.",
					"overall": "Shocking Advance is another good card with two good halves.<p>The initiative is excellent again, able to comfortably go before most enemies.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "swiftstrength",
					"top": "The top is a decent double target short ranged attack. Attack 2 isn’t going to win awards, and doesn’t scale well against shielded enemies, but the pull will sometimes be useful. More often than not, this top will only be used if the enemies pull a non-attack card when you were planning on shielding up and you need something to do. In that capacity, it does its job well.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is the main draw of this card; <i>Jump, Shield, Loot</i> and early initiative are a great combination for tanking, letting you get in the perfect spot to maximize mitigation and damage. It only being a Move 2 is a negative, but that’s where the Boots of Striding come in.",
					"overall": "Swift Strength is an excellent card no matter how you're using it."
				},

					"top": "Now this is a non-shield top action I can get behind! Attack 3 all adjacent enemies is extremely good for a level 1 card (the Red Guard will generally make more Light than they need, so the consumption here is easy to proc), and it makes an excellent finisher for the round after we’ve spiked a bunch of enemies with our shields.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is much less exciting; Attack 2 on bottom is standard, but boring, and we’ll almost never be able to use the Fire consumption on it.",
					"overall": "Twirling Stabs has two really powerful halves only let down by its initiative."
				},
				{
					"id": "warriorofthesun",

					"bottom": "The bottom is much less exciting; Attack 2 on bottom is standard, but boring, and while we could use Light, we have better uses for it.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is good in situations where the top is not: when dealing with high-HP, high-damage enemies.",
					"overall": "If you're playing Shield Spikes, Barbaric Instincts is obviously amazing.<p>The repositioning can be helpful for getting ranged enemies around you, which you can pair with Healing Sands or Stranglin' Chain bottom.</p>"

					"id": "harvestsickle",
					"top": "Harvest Sickle immediately gives us our first Attack 4, which is welcome already at level 2. The two elements on there can be useful to us or a companion, so they add a not-insignificant amount of value.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is just an amazing loss for the end of scenarios, which is convenient because you typically want to bring this card as late into a scenario as possible because of the top Attack.",
					"overall": "A powerful top action that most builds would be happy to spam all scenartio coupled with a goo last room loss on the bottom. The biggest downside of the card is the bad initiative."
				},
				{
					"id": "stranglingchain",
					"top": "The top is basically a super poison that has extra value on classes with multiple Attacks in a single action (cough cough Demolitionist), and it can ignore shields. Very good against bosses, where you'll want to combo this with the bottom attacks on Barbaric Instincts, Warrior of the Sun, or Twirling Stabs.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is great for the movement and the ability to lock enemies down next to you.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is a Disarm, which is decent even if it does anti-synergize with our Shield Spikes focus.",

					"bottom": "he bottom is okay, most useful for a killer Stranglin' Chain turn.",

				{
					"id": "honorablefury",
					"top": "Obviously with both elements, this top represents a lot of damage. And fortunately, for the only build that's taking this card (Standard), we just picked up Prismatic Sickle, which creates a very obvious and effect two-turn combo with this top.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, for every time we can't set up the elements with Prismatic Sickle's top, we can just use this bottom after a Harvest Sickle in order to get a good Move with a ton of direct damage.",

Move 3 Jump + 3-4 Shield is perfect for justifying Shield Spikes and the 11 initiative is beautiful for this sort of effect. We even have access to Wind thanks to Flying Sickle from level 6, so it's easy enough for us to get the full Shield 4 when we want it (it also makes perfect sense as you'll use Flying Sickle bottom when there's a single strong enemy to kill with Strangling Chain top but when there's not, you can use the top to set up this bottom).",

					"Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.",
					"This build is for when you have a tank in your party."

				{
					"id": "battlefieldmedicine",
					"top": "Saw has some really powerful losses, even at level 1 with things like Booster Shot and sometimes Vaccine, so the bar is quite high and this largely falls short. Why? A bunch of reasons:<ol><li> Healing losses are typically the worst losses in Gloomhaven. Healing just isn't something you normally want to do as a primary action in combat because it's basically just putting a band-aid on huge gash - you help with the symptoms, but you're not addressing the problem that lead to the symptoms, and thus things will just get worse again next turn. Typically, if you're in a bad spot, you're better off using a loss for a big attack or crowd control in order to survive combat and then heal up afterwards. For example, it's almost always better to use an Attack 4, Stun loss than a Heal 6 loss.</li><li>Even if you would desperately want healing badly enough to play a loss, this is delayed healing, so it doesn't even immediately address the problem. You have to play this and then wait another turn to just get the effect, which is insane!</li><li>Med Packs are a useful mechanic that we'll play with a fair amount on this class but the biggest thing med packs do is giving extra longevity (free turns), whether played for healing or default actions. A large med pack and a small med pack give the same amount of longevity, only one of them actually costs longevity to give.</li></ol>",
					"bottom": "The bottom non-loss is quite powerful (because immunity to negative conditions removes existing conditions) and is a bonus to movement. The problem is the initiative which means that the immunity comes after most enemy attacks will have happened so we would need to pair it with another lower initiative card to make the card really effective.",
					"overall": "Battlefield Medicine starts us off at a pretty low point. This card is simply not good, although it can be powerful on some scenarios. The biggest problem is that it's a loss combined with a highly situational effect. "
				},
				{
					"id": "bloodysaw",
					"top": "Attack 3, Wound is a perfectly reasonable amount of melee damage for a class at level 1. For comparison, the Mindthief can do Attack 4 (which is typically worse than this) and the Scoundrel can do Attack 5 but with conditions attached and she only has 9 cards to our 10, thus we're in a good spot with this Attack already.",
					"bottom": "Bottom Loot actions are generally quite bad (because you can't Move and Loot in the same turn, thus you're better off typically just moving and picking up coins by being on top of them at the end of your turn) but at least this one is attached to a top action that we want every rest cycle so it's pretty free to have it there and will mostly just help in scenarios that require Loot actions.",
					"overall": "Bloody Saw, on the other hand, is a very good card.<p>The initiative is pretty good, although we have some really good initiatives, still this card's initiative will matter because of the combo with Hold Back the Pain (seen later).</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "boostershot",
					"top": "First of all, the top Heal is more than reasonable for a level 1 Heal. Typically, we expect Heal 3, Range 3 and here we get 1 more healing at the cost of needing to be adjacent to the target. Fortunately, as we're a melee character who's likely to take a fair number of hits each scenario, many times the target will just be us. That being said, we're not actually going to have this Heal action for very long, as we're only keeping this card at low levels or if we intend on playing the bottom loss, and if we're playing the bottom loss, it's typically the earlier, the better.",
					"bottom": "The bottom loss is excellent if we have any sort of tank or tanky character in our party. With a Sunkeeper or Red Guard this action becomes overpowered as they are naturally tanky on their own and this is a significant boost to already powerful classes. Thus, it's more if you have a tanky melee ally, use this bottom loss as early as you conveniently can in most scenarios on that ally and watch them (and your whole party) enjoy the significant increase in damage mitigation.",
					"overall": "Booster Shot is another great card, although its true greatness will depend on your party."
				},
				{
					"id": "curativemixture",
					"top": "On top, we get 1 less healing than Booster Shot, but also the ability to remove negative conditions. The initial Poison removal means that the heal actually gets through to the target which makes this much more valuable. The top will still end up being useful outside of combat though, so neither half is bad.",
					"bottom": "It's often going to be more convenient to simply use this bottom action, which provides you with a 19-initiative Move 3, to remove the condition and instead still get to play a meaningful top action.",
					"overall": "Ultimately though, while being a nice card, our deck has a ton of nice cards, which means that beyond early levels, this isn't a card that's going to go into our deck by default. Instead, you should consider bringing it to each scenario on an individual basis depending on the negative conditions present.<p>It's decent against Poison-rich scenarios and it's excellent against Shaman (who can Disarm and Immobilize), excellent against level 4+ Wind Demons, Spitting Drakes (where you can get Stunned but also they do Muddle so it still does something), etc. So consider the scenario and the enemies and if it seems that there are enough conditions to merit this card, bring it. Otherwise, we've got better things to do.</p>"

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, when we're in combat, this card is just a casual Move 4 with 8 initiative. Yeah, I'd say that's pretty good. Our initiatives aren't bad overall, but we're no Scoundrel or Mindthief, so we do appreciate a really good initiative when we can get it, and this is it, as you're never going to be unhappy to 'have to play' a Move 4.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom here is more interesting as you can move to whichever party member needs the assistance before using your top heal. You can easily use this bottom with a top Heal to do a lot of healing, assuming damage has been pretty evenly spread.",
					"overall": "The initiative is also a lot worse here, as the 60-70 range is typically the worst initiative in the game (neither able to reliably go before or after enemies). That being said, we just don't have that many Attack actions, so even one that's worse than another we already have isn't terrible for us (and Bloody Saw is also a really good Attack, so this being a bit worse still makes this fine, if not exciting)."
				},
				{
					"id": "holdbackthepain",
					"top": "But first of all, the top action is fine here. If you somehow have this card in your hand while moving from room to room, it will provide a welcome Heal action. And pairing a top Heal (which is good out of combat) with a bottom action that is insane in combat is a great pairing.",
					"bottom": "So yeah, this bottom action... As I said in the introduction, this class often gets a bad rap as it's misunderstood as being a 'support class.' Does this bottom action look 'supporty' to you?! No, it looks insane! Any melee Attack you want can be a huge AoE! That scales incredibly well with levels and items. And it starts off as just letting you do an Attack 3 Wound on all adjacent enemies with 25 initiative.<p>It gets truly absurd at level 8. So how should you use this combo? You typically want to try to run in late so that the enemies go before you and you can get into a good spot safely (Hamstring [2] bottom Move is the natural combo), then go early in the next round with this combo. Obviously, you'll need some backup from your allies to help CC or kill some of the targets or you risk taking a lot of damage, but given the power level of what you're doing, they should be happy to help out.</p>",

					"id": "mobileresponse",
					"top": "The top is a powerful but situational persistent loss but it's honestly just not that good. In scenarios with negative conditions we care about, we already have Curative Mixture, which does the job much more freely. There's just basically never going to be a scenario where this effect is worth the cost, especially as we already have other good losses with much better effects than this, thus making it really difficult to justify the longevity cost on this one.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is very appealing. It's powerful, with good movement and allows us to attack and Wound AoE without the use of HBtP.",

And we've got enough excellent movement to easily get in position to make the most of this effect.</p>",
					"bottom": "The bottom isn't very good, by comparison, especially as it would mean not playing the top, but it may occasionally see some use at the very beginning of a scenario, especially when paired with Precaution (a card we'll take at level 3), assuming the layout of the first room isn't conducive to easily using the top. But in general, preventing enemies from attacking entirely > mitigating some of their damage. Take this card, keep it close, spam the top every chance you get, and laugh maniacally at the 25% of people who rated this class as 'underpowered.'",
					"overall": "This card has the ability to seriously impact rooms with it's AoE CC along with an initiative that allows us to get of off before most enemies can attack."
				},
				{
					"id": "syringe",
					"top": "The top - giving your tanky ally Shield 2 for the round, assuming that they're going to put themselves in a position to draw most or all of the enemy fire, is excellent at lower levels. That, combined with the bottom of Booster Shot, puts you at Shield 3, which will blank most low-level enemy attacks and has the initiative to get the assists up before either the tank or enemies go.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is extremely powerful, giving us hard CC on a bottom action that also adds Poison for free (this would be a fine bottom Attack at just Attack 1, Stun - compare to the Brute's Attack 2 on bottom or the Scoundrel's Attack 3 on bottom at level 1). You can easily move next to an enemy late in the previous round, then go early with this excellent initiative, Stun them, Poison then, and then benefit from the Poison with your top Attack as well (bonus points if your top Attack is Bloody Saw, where the Wound + the Stun here will do 2 extra damage)! Again, with actions like this we're combining good damage and CC, which makes us both a formidable damage-dealer who also prevents damage (the best kind of support).",
					"overall": "Syringe is another excellent card, which only seems less impressive because we just got done with one of the best level 1 cards in the game. Neither half is bad, although the bottom is the truly impressive part."

				{
					"id": "teamwork",
					"top": "his top action represents recovering a LOT of cards in a large party, especially with summons. The biggest problem with this action is that it kind of exists in Magical Christmas Land - you'll always imagine the best-case, but you rarely get it. In order for this to work, everyone needs to move in a specific way and they also all need to be at ideal points in their rest cycles where this gives back a meaningful amount of cards. Beyond that, this really needs to be done out of combat because of your lack of a combat-oriented top action combined with the movement restrictions for your allies, but recovering discarded cards out of combat is a lot less impressive (because you don't get to replay your best actions). Still, the effect can be impressive, so there's certainly room for the right party to try to build around this action, but on average I'd recommend just forgetting about it and focusing on the powerful and consistent actions you can perform regularly.",
					"bottom": "While the bottom isn't bad, it's also not great as our nature of being a melee-attacker/CC'er relies on us needing movement more than our allies, thus while technically more powerful than a Move 4, it's typically going to be worse.",

This taking place over six turns satisfies neither of those conditions and it's very possible that the last turn or two turns have very meaningless healing as we're out of the tough spot.</li><li>Playing the top would mean giving up our excellent Move 5 on bottom, so even in 'last room with plenty of longevity left' situation, we'd still just rather have the bottom.</li><li>After all that, the best-case is just a total of 12 healing for a loss (or a bit more if you combine this with Hand of the Surgeon but come on - that's not what you want to do in combat)!</li></ol><p>Avoid the top.</p>",
					"bottom": "But love the bottom! Move 5 at level 1 is really nice as while we have some good movement, we don't mind having a bit more, especially as many of our actions (Hold Back the Pain and Prevention is Key) are position-hungry.",
					"overall": "Triage is, on the other hand, NOT a powerful loss."
				},
				{
					"id": "vaccine",
					"top": "This top action is so, so, so, so good. Why? Well, first of all, small Attacks that spread Poison to multiple targets are great as you're typically looking at a lot of effective damage from this action. And because Poison gets better the more health the target has (as it will represent more damage), this action scales amazingly with levels and difficulty. Being ranged lets us apply this to high-hp targets (which are typically slow but hit hard) without putting ourselves in danger.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom loss is also quite powerful, although competes with Booster Shot (and is typically worse). The most common use for the bottom will be on scenarios with a lot of Poison that are also short and where you have a tanky ally (allowing you to put this and Booster Shot on the same ally). Again, that represents a large longevity cost, so the scenario does need to be short.",
					"overall": "Vaccine is, I believe, the most underrated level 1 card in the game.<p>More than anything, more than all the talk about how effective this top action is, the biggest value is in flexibility. Aside from this top action, we are entirely melee. Having a single ranged Attack adds sooooooo much flexibility into how we can still be effective in a huge variety of combat situations. Just ask any Brute how good Spare Dagger is for them - it's not because the action is that powerful, it's just because a single ranged Attack on an otherwise melee class will get an enormous amount of use. And this action is much, much more powerful than the already-excellent Spare Dagger.</p>"
				},
				{
					"id": "hamstring",
					"top": "The top is a strictly-better Hand of the Surgeon (although the Immobilize won't typically do much, most frequently just being a sort of Muddle on ranged enemies).",
					"bottom": "While that's already pretty good, the real amazing part of this card is the bottom, giving us a non-loss Move 6 at level 2. Again, we need lot of movement, so this is great. And while it seems like the Immobilize Self could be an issue, it's really not most of the time.<p>Because we have Hold Back the Pain, we'll most commonly play that bottom the turn after this, not caring about not being able to Move. We also have Syringe bottom we can play after this when we want to focus single targets rather than AoE, which is also excellent.</p>",
					"overall": "Unfortunately for Precaution (for now at least), it comes up against one of our core cards in Hamstring.<p>In the end, the bottom provides a ton of movement each scenario, the top will sometimes get used, and overall this card will always be excellent for us</p>"
				},

					"top": "The top action can be very good as it works at any range. Typically, we'd rather be attacking, but if we want to not move for some reason at the beginning of a scenario but still want to help our allies out defensively (like if we're setting up Booster Shot bottom on our tank the first turn or playing Prevention bottom) we can pair that with this top to get a lot of damage mitigation across our entire party. Unfortunately, being a top action that just gives one Shield does mean it scales quite poorly with levels.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is also good. Again, if we're somewhere we don't need to move and we already have a good top to play (we're finishing an enemy off in melee range and we have another melee ally next to us, or if we want to use Vaccine with good initiative to get Poison before our allies attack and we're standing next to them, like at the beginning of a scenario), we can get a free med pack to an ally, which is really nice value. Also, if our allies are long resting or catching up with us (as we have some great movement compared to many classes) when between combat, we can play this bottom with First Aid top to give out two med packs in a turn, which is sweet.",
					"overall": "Precaution is just a really nice card.<p>Mmost importantly, with everything we do, this card provides good initiative, and sometimes can even just be a Move 2 with good initiative if we really need it. So while it's not exceptional in any way, it does a lot of little things and accrues quite solid value over the course of a scenario.</p>"

Its best use is removing Poison and sometimes Wound, but it's worse than Booster Shot bottom by a significant margin (because both require a tanky ally who will draw fire) and if we really can afford to play a second persistent loss early and we're concerned with Poison and Wound, we've got Vaccine. The situation for this is basically 'short scenarios with a tanky ally and no negative conditions' and even then (its best case) it's only so-so for a loss.",

Beyond that, we also have other great losses to play (Booster Shot/Research the Cure, Do No Harm). Overall, I find the inconsistency of trying to make this combo work not worth the power increase, by a significant margin.",

Our most effective actions don't revolve around being a support (with the exception of CC, which is support in a way), it's more that we get to support as a bonus sometimes.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, this bottom action is also soooo good. It will represent so much free healing over the course of each scenario, all while playing a Move 4, which is more than fine, with an initiative that we really want (because we lack good late initiatives with Moves). The bottom is great, the top is great, they're perfectly paired together, the initiative is welcome. What more can you ask for, honestly?",

Still, most of the time it will be a good single-target Attack, and the late initiative combined with the Immobilize does allow us to run in late, hit a melee enemy with this, and then run away early the next turn, leaving the Wounded enemy to bleed out.</p>",
					"bottom": "Finally, the bottom seems like a strange action but it's also quite good (just because it's attached to a spammable top). 7 is a lot of healing for a non-loss Heal action and you will often be able to use this just before a long rest on the target so that the Stun does nothing. You can also use it to keep annoying allies you need to escort from being too much of a pain.",

Poison is the bane of tanks everywhere and just negating that alone is already a bunch more health saved.",

That does lead to losing a ton of longevity though, so it needs to be a short scenario, but it also takes two turns of setup, which means it also needs to be a scenario where you don't need to move a ton. The best example of this would be a single-room defence scenario or something like that.</p>"

Admittedly, this one is kind of difficult to use for the time-being (until level 9 when it just gets really dumb) so it's kept in check a bit. The most common way for us to use this top on our own is by pairing it with the bottom of Syringe. Otherwise, it can be paired with the top of Amputate, but that's obviously significantly worse as we had to make a big Attack on the enemy we're now executing.",
					"bottom": "Regardless, you will find some ways to use the top before 9, but the main draw of this card is the bottom. Syringe was good at level 1, it's still fine at level 6, and this is a much better bottom (sadly with significantly worse initiative, which does hurt). Wound + Stun is already 2 damage, plus the 1 Attack, and then the Poison as well... mmm... This bottom represents a lot of damage combined with CC and all on a bottom action, leaving us free to use other top actions. Glorious! Two good halves, one that's better now, one that's insane at level 9, makes for an excellent card that we're certainly not about to pass up.",

Meanwhile, the bottom is another loss for large med packs, which suffers from all the same issues as Battlefield Medicine at level 1. Honestly, our level 1 card First Aid is just a better card than this level 6 card, as while the top is strictly worse, the overall card is better. So yeah, not very tempting at level 6.",

This picks up the mantel of First Aid by being a Move 4 with excellent initiative, only here we also get XP (which doesn't matter so much at level 7 although the sooner we get to 8 and 9, the better) and a free value med pack. Again, cards like Prescription are not how we give out med packs because they just cost us too much to have - cards like this, where we get to give out med packs for free, are how our allies are getting free longevity. Sure, many times, especially if you don't have melee allies, this won't hand out med packs. It's important to not overly obsess with getting the maximum effect from this bottom every time - it's a Move 4 and sometimes it also does something else. And that's more than fine.",

					"bottom": "But the real reason this card is amazing is the bottom. First of all, the bottom adds a ton of damage on its own, easily affecting 2-3 enemies most of the time. But it's not just for this action on its own that it matters, the best part is combining this bottom with the top of Euthanize, which allows us to execute a normal or elite enemy outright, which is quite broken.

So really, there's almost no world in which this top is appealing.",
					"bottom": "The bottom, on the other hand, is great. It's a Move 4 with good initiative and a Stun attached.

					"Saw has two defining conditions when building him: do you have a tank in your party or not? Accordingly, we will have two builds. Why is that so important? The persistent losses Booster Shot and Research the Cure, which are some of the best persistent-losses in the game, really only work with a tank. The best part about these cards is that you can be the difference in the party between a class that can 'kind of' tank on its own to become a full-fledged tank. Some classes in the game have their own tank builds that don't quite have enough support within the class itself (classes like Mindthief and a few unlockable classes), but throwing an additional permanent Shield 1 on top will usually make the difference between wonky and truly effective. And obviously if you throw that Shield on top of someone who's naturally very tanky, you can end up with some of the most broken combos in the game. Furthermore, what's amazing about this is you don't need to become 'a support' in order to have this effect - you just have to play a single persistent loss, which is realistic enough to do as you otherwise have great non-loss actions and a 10-card hand size, so you can certainly afford the one early loss per scenario.",

					"top": "Saw has some really powerful losses, even at level 1 with things like Booster Shot and sometimes Vaccine, so the bar is quite high and this largely falls short. Why? A bunch of reasons:<ol><li> Healing losses are typically the worst losses in Gloomhaven. Healing just isn't something you normally want to do as a primary action in combat because it's basically just putting a band-aid on huge gash - you help with the symptoms, but you're not addressing the problem that lead to the symptoms, and thus things will just get worse again next turn. Typically, if you're in a bad spot, you're better off using a loss for a big attack or crowd control in order to survive combat and then heal up afterwards.

Still, other than the already-recommended enhancements, we don't have anything spectacular, and this still really good, so it is our third (or second, again depending on items) choice."
