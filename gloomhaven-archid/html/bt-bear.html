   <p>This build is for the bear build where the Beast Tyrant does not engage in combat directly, instead commanding the bear to perform attacks instead.</p> <p>There are a couple of implications for this, the first is that you tend not to pick up as much loot as you are not moving with the battle and standing on coins as you go, the second is that there are some scenarios where the complete party need to travel to exit hexes in which case you need to keep Disorienting Roar in your hand that lets you swap places with the bear.</p>

              <p>To set this top action up properly you need to have lost 2 cards in the last round (your other x cards) or rely on allies. However, your allies likely have better uses for the elements to do more than 4 damage or heal you for more than 4.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom of this card is super interesting if you are going mass summons. Technically your bear and all your summons have the same initiative, so you can have your bear go before them and tank damage while your summon army follows it and adds their own dmg/poison/etc. If your weak summons take damage, you can siphon that off onto the bear and then use Patch Fur. The weakness of this strategy is both this and patch fur are bottom halves/ so you could be playing with fire as you wait a turn to heal up. Note that this says “allied summons,” so you could use this card to siphon bear HP onto your Spellweaver's Spirit Ally, for example. Also note the Tyrant is included in this pool of health, if you are feeling safe - or if you want to heal yourself using the bear's HP.</p>

              <p>Disarm is great when your bear is going to take a lot of damage otherwise. Luckily you can get another disarm later.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom of this card is fantastic, especially later on when you got more and more bottom attack cards. Pop this down on the first turn, then later play something like relentless ally to give your bear an attack 5 with his auto summon attack. Then play a bottom attack 2 to give your bear another attack 5. That's 10 damage on a turn. Later when the bear gets a multi-attack bottom we start wreaking havoc. The movement part might be useful if your move commands are in your discard, but usually we want the +3 attack.</p>

              <p>This is a self heal and does not do anything for the bear so not something we can use as we shouldn't be taking damage outside the first room and there are items to help with that.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Note the two spots on the bottom for enhancements. Cheap to make this an attack 4. +4 with CR, that's an attack 7 on top of your bear's auto attack for 5.</p>

              <p>The top is pretty good when you first enter a room (that is, someone else enters the room because the bear can't open doors) and need to put out fires if your door opener is going to get surrounded by elites. The issue is you want to do damage when your bear is next to something, but if your bear is surrounded, this is a fine option before moving him away and regrouping.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom of this card literally breaks multiple scenarios. Does the scenario require you to grab a treasure in the back of a huge room with 4 groups of enemies? Swap your invisible scoundrel with the baddie in the back and beat the scenario in 3 turns (have actually done this). Is the boss behind tons of traps and enemies? Swap them for the skeleton you've surrounded in the other room. It also allows your bear to act as a proxy in escape scenarios, as you can move your bear to the escape zone and swap yourself there.</p>

              <p>Damn this card is fun.<p>I'm honestly surprised this card didn't get “nerfed” in the 2nd edition to at least require line of sight.

              <p>3 damage at 3 range is up to par with other ranged attacks at level 1. Note you cannot increase the damage and it is an attack by the tyrant.</p>

              <p>The bottom of this card is amazing. Damage 7 with CR plus XP and Earth, what's not to like.</p>

              <p>This is a great card for us that gives a big bear attack or even a first room tyrant attack if that is what we need.</p>

              <p>The top of this card is just OK. 2 damage is nothing to get excited about, and it's costly to make this an attack 3. And you shouldn't, because you get a multi-attack 3 later.<p>Top bear attacks are not what we want as we can't use CR on them and this means that we only get a single attack, which in this case is fairly weak and leaves our bear vulnerable next to multiple enemies.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>It's too bad the top is just ok, because the bottom is useful in trap scenarios. Generally you don't want to be pushing people away from your bear, but if you get 2 attacks in and then you can push your target into a trap, this is a good card. Give it some thought if you see 4+ trap tokens being pulled during setup. Adding Immobilize to the bottom of this neutralises a melee enemy if you pair the card with an early initiative.</p>

              <p>Doing 1 damage, even to 3 targets, doesn't help anyone. It can be augmented, but there are better actions tro spend your enhancements on.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom will help your bear move around, at least. Especially if ranged guys are behind tanky enemies (your bear will focus like a monster and keep hitting the tanks without your direction, remember). Also useful if no enemies are around, because the bear will do nothing w/o a focus – so run him towards the next door instead.</p>

              <p>If you are starting at level 1 with this character and running a bear style, you will take this card because the “x” cards are generally summon/hybrid cards. The hybrid build gets less out of this, though the bottom still has value to give the bear focus on what he attacks.</p>

              <p>The bottom has a nice move with a shield tacked on, but without spoiling anything there is an item that will basically replace the need to use this move action.</p>

              <p>The bottom of this card is a <i>Loot 2</i> Command (the bear doesn't loot on the end of its turn, like all other summons). Loot 2 is a big area and can hoover up a lot of gold. This is useful for scenarios requiring you to loot a treasure tile, and if you are cash starved as it is your only loot card.</p>

              <p>The bottom is Disorienting Roar jr. I can see this useful for the same reasons as mentioned above in DR – you can also do it multiple times, but only to enemies.

              <p>The bottom is useful for the Active Tyrant archetype, but that role would like multiple targets in exchange for 4 health healed here, as summons rarely survive after taking 4 damage. I guess your allies or bear might like this. The early move on top is a bonus.</p>

              <p>Finally, a way to deal with shields, and by the time you are level 4 you will be seeing many shields. This will one-hit certain difficult enemies with big shields and low health. It's a tick slower than your other attacks, though. It's easy to sub out when no shields are in the monster selection.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is somewhat useful if you need to move your Tyrant out of danger more than a default 2. You also get the bonus of adding to your bear's attack if the top you use is a command. However, without spoiling, an item later in the game will make this bottom pretty much forgotten.</p>

              <p>You have to be pretty desperate to use this top. I suppose if your bear is off alone getting absolutely hammered by multiple enemies it has its purpose. Keep in mind this works with multiple attacks on a turn, as it does not say 'next 5 attack actions'. So every time you draw an attack modifier card you gain 2 health. At least that's how I read it.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The bottom is your Patch Fur replacement. With CR this is an attack 6 heal 3, and both are augmentable (Maybe make that heal also bless).</p>

              <hr>
              <p>The bottom gives you back some summons, which opens up your ability to get friends out early rather than waiting for the last room(s). That said, this card feels like something you should have gotten back at level 7.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
              <p>For a capstone card this is very disappointing. Double burn where the top is very situationally useful and the bottom only useful at the end of the scenarion so this card ends up being a very late Move 2 for most of the time.</p>
