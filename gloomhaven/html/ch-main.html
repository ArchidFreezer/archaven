    <p>The Cragheart is, by most accounts, one of the best-designed classes in the game. He is also typically one of the scariest classes for new players. So let's try to break it all down:<ul><li>He is tanky but he's not a 'tank.' Despite his tankiness, he prefers to attack from range and, eventually, use obstacles to impede enemies' paths.</li><li>He does a lot of direct (unmitigated) damage, making him good, at least at early levels, at dealing with enemies with low hp and high shield. His direct damage can also affect allies, meaning he prefers ranged allies to melee ones. That statement is doubly true because of his obstacles, which ranged allies find much more helpful.</li><li>He has some of the most powerful actions of any starting class (for example, Massive Boulder at level 1) but has two very severe drawbacks as well: initiative and movement.</li><li>He has, quite possibly, consistently the worst initiative in the game and his movement at level 1 is pretty abysmal.</li></ul></p>
    <p>For any Cragheart, as you level up, you should try to mitigate his weaknesses, but in a 2p party especially, movement and initiative are extremely important. In 4p, if you go slowly and can't go before the enemies, it's only 25% of your party, but if you have the same thing happen in 2p, it's 50% of your party, which is obviously an enormous difference. Accordingly, it's very, very important to be able to have good initiative which allows us to coordinate effectively with our partner.</p>
    <p>Focus on being a ranged damage-dealer as much of the time as possible, coming into melee only when you're out of ranged attacks or using melee attacks and moving away when enemies have closed on you. Your secondary role is support as you do have some nice amount of healing.</p>
    <p>Once you get access to Rock Slide at level 4, that will define your role, as you'll constantly want to try to figure out how to deal maximum damage with that action while also preventing enemies from getting to your team (allowing you to perform both of your roles, support and ranged damage, with one action).</p>
