		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>The Tank build is more of a sub-build of a Spear build than a completely independent build, given the Banner Spear doesn't have that many dedicated tanking cards. But more than anything, choosing to play this build represents a slightly different focus, which is based on protecting the party as much as possible rather than maximizing your damage output.
		<p>So why would you play a Tank Build?
		<ul>
			<li>Your group is mostly fragile and cannot afford to take many hits. In that case, your party will typically have plenty of damage output, but survivability will be a concern. Accordingly, rather than focusing on your output, your focus will be keeping everyone alive.		<li>You lack melee allies who can consistently help you out in setting up formations. While you will still play some formation attacks, you'll mostly stick to the easier ones, and you'll still play less of them.
		</ul>
		
		<p>The tank build loves the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Boneshaper. A Boneshaper appreciates having a tank to keep her summons alive longer, allowing them to deal more damage. And while you care less about formations than a Spear build, you do still use some of them, which Skeletons help you to more easily set up.		<li>Damage-dealers and a bit of support. Obviously every tank would like a bit of support for healing, and as you're going to be more focused on mitigating incoming damage to the party, you do need allies whose primary aim is killing enemies.		<li>An example of an ideal four-character party for a Tank build would be something like: Ranged+Healing Drifter, Skeleton Swarm Boneshaper, Ranged Deathwalker, and Banner Spear.
		</ul>

							<p>The top action allows you to heal your entire party at a cost. For this action to be worth playing, you really need to heal at least two allies, at which point it's already very good with a net of positive four hit points, on top of dealing with a variety of negative conditions that are removed by healing (also note that you don't suffer any damage when you remove Poison from an ally). Additionally, a ranged/support Banner Spear will likely not take many hits but has a large pool of hit points to draw from, meaning the cost here is often insignificant, making this even better.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is also incredibly useful. At the very least, it's pretty much always going to be a pre-castable Disarm, which as a non-loss bottom is great. But obviously the real value here is having an ally whose movement you control precisely who acts immediately before your turn each round, moving into position to help you set up your AoE patterns. At lower player counts or in parties without melee allies, if you're playing for a melee focus, you should consider that keeping this summon active is mandatory. And even when you have allies who can, in theory, help you, they may not always be willing to. Accordingly, look to play this bottom action as early as you can and resummon it when necessary if it dies.

							<p>The top action is stellar just because it's so easy to perform and still has a strong payoff.
							<hr>
							<p>The biggest reason you'll end up using the top action less than you expect is just because the bottom action is so essential for most of what you do. If you're playing with a Banner, you'll need this to move the Banner through the scenario. If you're focusing on AoEs, you'll want to use this to move an ally into position on the same turn you use a top AoE action.

							<p>The top action is underwhelming without Air but it's also very free for you to make Air at some point with the top of Javelin, so you can pretty consistently count on getting this powered-up once per rest cycle. At that point it's a solid action but nothing really incredible. Obviously if you have the persistent Shield 1 from Unbreakable Wall, then the synergy with Disadvantage is solid, and that gives you a good turn that combines offense and defence.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action promises a tremendous amount of Shield but is quite difficult to use. You lack top movement, which means you need to already be in position to use this from the round before. That's not necessarily difficult, but the difficult part is that it typically involves you sprinting to the front line to make sure the ranged enemies will be attacking you next round. The problem with that is that there will often also be melee enemies, and moving to the front and then not moving for the round is going to lead to getting hit by them, which you could often have avoided by just moving more safely. So overall, the bottom has incredible potential (get up to Shield 3 for the round and just shrug off all of the ranged attacks in the room) but is pretty difficult to use effectively on any consistent basis.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Deflecting Manoeuvre is another solid filler card.<p>Of course, with a very spammable top action, the bottom will be there when you need it and can find a good use for it at a very low cost

							<p>If you have the Banner of Strength out, the top is actually very good. When you're playing a ranged character who has some valuable non-move bottom actions like repositioning the Banner or summoning a sacrificial Reinforcement, Attack 3, Range 4 with advantage may honestly even be better than Attack 4, Range 3. Either way, you'll be happy to have them both.<p>For most builds, unless you have an ally who really needs the Light, the top just doesn't pack enough punch to justify.
							<hr>
							<p>The Banner on the bottom is strong, its biggest drawback is just not really being as strong or essential as Banner of Strength while being another persistent loss on a 10-card class. Going down to 9 cards is perfectly viable in an average scenario, but going down to 8 cards and also having to transport both Banners through the scenario is just not going to be worth it for this Banner's added bonuses. Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>The top action has quite a lot of potential but does have some drawbacks. First of all, you simply cannot use this in situations where a -1 would yield no Wound because that's just too likely of a blowout. Accordingly, you need to increase the base attack value to 2, which can be done with the Banner of Strength or Resolved Courage's bottom action. Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there. Obviously you need to be mindful of scenarios with large numbers of enemies with Shield, where this is again more likely to deal no damage. Which is unfortunately because Wound is typically very good against shielded enemies.
							<hr>
							<p>Meanwhile, I'm not really sure what to make of the bottom. I've used it a bit and it's fine but it's pretty risky and doesn't have a lot of movement. I think it's fine to just throw down in some single-room extremely high tempo scenarios as a fire-and-forget bottom loss that will help out for a few turns and then eat some attacks and die, but I wouldn't really recommend worrying about it beyond that (or otherwise just for two much-needed experience on a Banner build as a throwaway loss at the end of the scenario).

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>With the Banner of Strength active, this top action is an excellent Attack 4, Range 3. Without it, Attack 3, Range 3 is still a fine action and making sure you always have one ranged attack allows you to be effective even on rounds when you can't afford to run up to the enemies, so you'll always be happy to have this around even if it doesn't wow you with its damage.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is meant to help you set up your AoEs by pulling an enemy into the requisite hex while you have the rest of the pattern set up. This does sometimes work in practice, but the Move 1 is still very limiting and makes it harder to use than something like Combined Effort's bottom. Bonus movement boots would help a lot here but jump boots are essential on a melee Banner Spear, which makes this remaining at a true Move 1 sting.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Javelin is a solid filler card for most builds but a core card for a ranged/support Banner Spear.<p>If you have access to enhancement, this is a good place to stick a cheap +1 Move enhancement, which can make this bottom a lot more consistently useful.

						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>The top action is theoretically very powerful but is by far the most difficult pattern we have at level 1. Jump boots can help a reasonable amount (if you have an ally adjacent to an enemy you can use a Move 4 bottom with the boots to go to the other side and fulfil the pattern) but even then it can be difficult, you won't always have them available, and that will often put you in a very dangerous position. Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss. And in that case, being your highest single-target damaging attack ability certainly sits well. But most of the time, I'd just recommend not trying to play around the top.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom, on the other hand, is a very solid loot action. You need supplies for Frosthaven and this can get you them. The bottom would be much better with movement boots, which you won't have on a melee Banner Spear but can pick up in a ranged/support build (of course, if you're already in melee, it's easier to move with this to pick up the loot).

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Pincer Movement is definitely the most replaceable card we've looked at yet.<p>If you have access to enhancements, this is a very good candidate for a +1 Move enhancement, which makes this bottom action excellent.

							<p>A non-loss Attack 3, Disarm at level 1 is an amazing action. And while there is a condition on it, this is still one of your easier patterns to set up (remember that you can always mirror, flip, and rotate these patterns). So great payoff for little setup? Yes, please! What's the downside? Well, the downside is that the bottom action on this card is also incredible and deprives you of the top.
							<hr>
							<p>The Banner of Strength is the core Banner for a ranged/support Banner Spear. In any larger party or party with summons (hello Skeleton Swarm Boneshaper!), this adds a tremendous amount of damage over the course of the scenario if you can have it keep up with the party.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Rallying Cry is another core card for every Banner Spear.<p>The big challenge is the banner doesn't move on its own, meaning you'll need to spend a fair amount of time moving it yourself. Quite simply: that is difficult to do while also moving as much as you need to in order to effectively tank or be a melee damage-dealer, which is why this will mostly just be used in a ranged/support build, outside of scenarios that take place entirely in a single room.

							<p>In between rooms this is a nice top action, and regenerate works well before a long rest as it clears Poison prior to the heal.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is fairly useless outside a Banner build, where you need all of the tools you can get to move your Banner from room to room, and a granted Move 3 is better than a Move 2. The significance of this action for the build is a big reason why the build is more ranged focused: you need to play this action once each rest cycle, and it's much easier to play it on a turn where you're performing a ranged attack or a heal than a melee attack.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Regroup is another filler card for most builds although is still less valuable in that role than something like Javelin. It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter. Here, that's not really the case for any tanking or melee builds, as this lacks movement while also not having excellent initiative. Typically, something like Combined Effort will be significantly more convenient to use.

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>To start, the top's pattern is typically significantly easier to pull off than the similar-but-different Tip of the Spear. It's also worth noting that this top pairs very well with summoning the Reinforcements in combat. You can play that bottom action and then have the pattern for this top set up immediately in the same round. This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies. It is theoretically possible to engineer a situation where you're able to run in late, then do this top, then run away the following round, but it requires some really precise positioning from your allies and the monsters such that I wouldn't fixate on it.
							<hr>
							<p>Then the bottom is just a nice value action. It's not anything amazing, but being able to play this card for the bottom action to ensure you go before some monsters, and then still getting some bonus damage out of the deal is pretty sweet. The most obvious combo at level 1 is certainly with Unbreakable Wall, which both has more forgiving targeting to accommodate not moving, and also more possible targets. Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well. And lastly, don't forget to check what your allies are doing on rounds when you play this: it might be worth using this bottom after your attack for the turn if you have something like a nearby Deathwalker or Geminate ally performing a big AoE attack.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Resolved Courage is an excellent card and definitely my favourite of Banner Spear's 'X' cards. It kind of has it all: strong top attack that's not too difficult to pull off, nice value bottom action, and excellent initiative.

							<p>The top action is passable if you're playing the tanking persistent loss. It should never really be a focus, but there are a couple of reasons you might play it: you can't or don't want to get all the way to the enemies to attack or you're facing enemies where direct damage is more profitable than attacking (typically enemies with high Shield or Retaliate values).
							<hr>

							<p>This top action just absolutely annihilates high-Shield enemies. And even against low-Shield or no-Shield enemies, it's still solid if you can hit two targets. Of course, that is a reasonably sized 'if', as this is one of your more difficult ally positioning requirements to pull off. If the Reinforcements are alive, it shouldn't be too difficult to make this work. Without them, you'll need an ally to stand in a specific spot for you, but then face some issues with initiative such that 06 is too fast and your ally won't be there in time but 32 or 67 are obviously too slow. So your best bet is certainly the Reinforcements or otherwise a very speedy ally like a Blinkblade.
							<hr>
							<p>The good news is that the bottom action is a very spammable and welcome Move 4, one of only two at level 1, meaning we'll always be happy to have this card around, and when the top lines up well against the right types of enemies, you'll get an amazing payoff at very little opportunity cost.

							<p>The condition for this AoE attack ability is very easy to meet: just stand next to an ally.

Your normal expectation should be to hit two enemies with this.

							<p>The biggest frustration people have with this card is thinking they should hit two targets with it most of the time and when they don't, it's a disappointment. Not at all! While you can occasionally hit two targets thanks to your Jump boots, the vast, vast majority of uses for this top action should be a single Attack 4, Wound with a targeting pattern identical to Rallying Cry. And that's still very good! Combined Effort is an excellent top and the only thing keeping us from using it more is the bottom, but now you can have Combined Effort top and bottom, effectively.

							<p>The top action is more of a modal action: either you use it with Air as a long range Immobilize to prevent an incoming attack, or you don't need to bother with the Air and you use it to do some significant damage to finish off a target your allies have already engaged.
							<hr>
							<p>Meanwhile, the bottom is kind of a budget Regroup - while the added range and ally are nice if you're concerned with helping out your teammates, the reduced movement when doing something like moving a Banner is significantly worse. Of course, if you're moving Banners, even a budget Regroup is still a welcome addition.

							<p>The top is the same pattern as Tip of the Spear, which is a somewhat difficult pattern to pull off on Tip of the Spear, but is significantly easier here as you only need to target one enemy. Attack 7, Stun is a powerful effect, but it's pretty rare that it's going to be worth giving up your level 3 card early into the scenario just for this one-shot loss.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is just great though - you'll be happy to have this action every rest cycle. You actually lack a late initiative big move (the 67 on Tip of the Spear is not late enough to be reliable), so this fills that hole while providing a bunch of bonuses. The AoE Muddle lends itself well to AoEing a group of enemies who won't all die next round, and the Air is extremely free to power up Deflecting Manoeuvre.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Head of the Hammer is a solid workhorse card, although not much of that has to do with the top.<p>Realistically, you'll use the bottom all scenario, and then try to use the top in the last room for a boost of power and three nice experience.

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>Let Them Come's top action is exceptional value. The pattern is super easy to set up - you just need to be adjacent to an ally, facing some number of enemies. Even if you only hit a single enemy, you're still getting two Attack, Poison, four Healing, and an experience. And it's not very difficult to hit two enemies most of the time.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action, on the other hand, is rather niche. It helps to enable a really powerful combo at level 9 and otherwise can just be thrown down in single-room defence scenarios. But otherwise, if you're focused on using Banners, Banner of Strength is going to give you more value that's also easier to use most of the time. While Shield 1 against all enemies attacks is inherently more powerful than +1 Attack on one attack per character, the restriction of needing to keep this adjacent to whoever is taking those attacks for it to be effective is just too much work for it to be worth it in most scenarios.

							<p>Boldening Blow top provides an incredible pattern payoff with some difficult conditions to meet. First of all, to be clear, this gives you a single Attack 4, Disarm, not multiple. Now that that's been cleared up - Attack 4, Disarm and two Blesses is a crazy amount of power for a level 4 non-loss action. The counterpoint is that it's also very difficult to set up this pattern.
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom gives a Move action for both yourself and a couple of allies to set up your AoEs.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Fortunately, the top, while the flashy half of the card, is not the biggest reason to take the card - it's the bottom. The bottom is everything you could ever want on a Banner Spear. Trying to set up formations? Move yourself and allies a bunch. Playing with a Banner?<p>How about you get the invaluable Regroup bottom action and also get to move yourself. So yeah, if you take this card, you take it for the bottom action, which you'll be more than happy to use every single rest cycle, and then maybe in one out of every five times you play this card, you'll be able to set up the top and get an amazing payoff.

							<p>So the top is just Unbreakable Wall, except targeting on both sides and with some bonus movement. Overall a pretty sweet deal in terms of an upgrade. It's less that you're going to somehow put yourself in the middle of 5-6 enemies with an ally, and more having three extra hexes gives you more flexibility for targeting and will on average net you one additional target. Definitely a reasonable upgrade. Of course, that's not really what makes the card appealing.
							<hr>
							<p>The real deal on this card is the bottom action. It's difficult to really put into words just how profound this effect is. So many times, you'll find yourself or an ally just a tiny bit away from where you need everyone to be in order to pull off the pattern. This just makes that happen, routinely. And it's also just a lot of free movement for you and your allies over the course of the scenario. Give it a try and you'll see. And if somehow you're not impressed, you can still always fall back on the top.

							<p>Shield 2 as a top action, at 5 initiative, is perfect for tanking. And the AoE Shield also mitigates against multi-target enemies or somewhat spread out allies.

							<p>The bottom loss is just solid for a last-room effort as you can get the same amount of Shield with movement and Retaliate thrown in on a bottom action so you can still attack. You should never really play this before the end of the scenario, but at the end, you'll be happy it's there.

						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle">
							<p>Barricade is a pretty powerful pattern pay off with some pretty demanding requirements. Between Explosive Epicenter and Boldening Blow, you have enough granted movement by now to make this happen. Unfortunately, there's often going to be a pretty real drawback as well - frequently one of your two allies that helps you with this pattern is going to be the Reinforcement. It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up. If you don't have enough melee allies who are consistently around you, then it's not going to be worth it. And while the payoffs seem like exactly what a tank would want, the tank build just isn't set up to provide enough movement to make this happen regularly (and even then, you'd be putting the allies you're tanking for in pretty risky spots to get the payoff).
							<hr>
							<p>The better action on Barricade by a reasonable margin is the bottom. This Banner is incredibly powerful - it's just a free Disarm every single round as long as you can keep it next to someone who will get attacked at least once in the round. That's not very difficult to do. And then it has some nice synergies with self-damage, like the Boneshaper's level 6 summon that makes her suffer six damage. It's so easy to set this up to negate that and that's such a huge swing for the Boneshaper.
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Accordingly, what are the use cases for actually taking Barricade at 6?<p>If you're going to spend a lot of time at level 9. The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well. In any of these cases, just treat Bolstering Shout as Barricade for the rest of the guide.

							<p>The +2 Attack is significant if it is powered up. Obviously, we need to have melee allies adjacent to enemies to make this work. The Reinforcement and the Bird can both help with this although we can't really count on both of them all of the time, so it's important to have at least one melee ally. Of course, if you're playing a Banner-focused build, it's likely you have one or more (anyone call for a Boneshaper?) And lastly, once we get to level 9, we'll have a very easy combo to set this up.
							<hr>
							<p>Ranged summons are historically very, very powerful in any Gloomhaven game. They just sit around, pretty much never dying, immune to almost all Retaliate (the bane of most normal summons), consistently outputting damage. With Range 4, this will attack safely pretty much every turn. Move 2 is generally enough, although can sometimes lag behind. Fortunately, most of your granted movement has an extra target, so you can move this and a Banner through the scenario at the same time. And then it also adds a small amount of free mitigation as a bonus with the Muddle, which is far from necessary but certainly welcome.

							<p>A bottom move with acceptable initiative that also makes a bunch of free attacks? Yes please! Bottom attacks alongside a move are just some of the best actions in the game. Attack 1 isn't very impressive, but by now you should have an excellent attack modifier deck, meaning the real value here is drawing three cards with obvious highlights like the rolling Shield or the Disarm. This bottom action really wants you to have Air as it makes the targeting so much easier.

							<p>Tri-Thrust is essentially Boldening Blow version 2.<p>The top is very difficult to pull off. Occasionally, between the bottom of Boldening Blow and the persistent from Explosive Epicenter, you may be able to do it. And at level 8, it will even get substantially easier. Until then, the bottom is the real draw of this card.

							<p>This is the Resolved Courage pattern except with the gray and blue hex swapped. I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.
							<hr>
							<p>The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions. Now, how much better than Meat Grinder bottom is this really? Definitely better, although probably not the difference between level 2 and level 8 better. Although I think this says more about how great Meat Grinder bottom is at level 2 than necessarily being a condemnation of this at level 8. I'd take this at level 8 and always be happy to have this action. If Taunting Howl didn't exist.

							<p>Whilst this is undoubtably a powerful top, the synergy benefits of the bottom are immense when setting up our other cards.
							<hr>
							<p>Move + Granted Move is what we generally like more than anything, but the downside is that Combined Effort and Boldening Blow have historically had poor initiatives. Here we get an excellent amount of movement (9 in total!) while also going at a speedy 11 initiative. It's everything you could ever want. Suddenly, setting up the top of Tri-Thrust doesn't seem so difficult. And right now, you're probably saying 'But Gripeaway, you skipped the top!' To which I'll just respond 'Did I?'

							<p>Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.
							<hr>
							<p>And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears. Of course, given the stamina you already lost from the beginning, this won't work for long, but obviously it's better than having the top of Hail of Spears and no Banners.

							<p>The tops biggest weakness is going to be enemies with Shield. Sure, Poison is useful against them, but spending a fair amount of setup and your level 9 card just to apply AoE Poison and maybe a tiny bit of damage against them isn't great. The key here is the number of our modifier cards that will be drawn.
							<hr>
							<p>Fortunately, the bottom is excellent against enemies with Shield by virtue of being direct damage. It has huge range and a lot of health so it's unlikely to die and it's pretty likely to damage most enemies in most rounds of the scenario. While it might seem like it's not a big upgrade over Banner of Strength, it's worth considering the number of enemy turns vs ally turns. Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength. And by being at the start of each enemy's turn, you always get the damage at an effective time rather than relying on character initiative. The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.

							<p>It's hard to look at Take No Prisoners and not just start chuckling in amusement. It's just pretty absurd. And it would be justifiably difficult to set up if only we hadn't just taken Taunting Howl.
