					"The Tank build is more of a sub-build of a Spear build than a completely independent build, given the Banner Spear doesn't have that many dedicated tanking cards. But more than anything, choosing to play this build represents a slightly different focus, which is based on protecting the party as much as possible rather than maximizing your damage output."
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Your group is mostly fragile and cannot afford to take many hits. In that case, your party will typically have plenty of damage output, but survivability will be a concern. Accordingly, rather than focusing on your output, your focus will be keeping everyone alive.",
					"You lack melee allies who can consistently help you out in setting up formations. While you will still play some formation attacks, you'll mostly stick to the easier ones, and you'll still play less of them."
				],
				"preferences": [
					"Boneshaper. A Boneshaper appreciates having a tank to keep her summons alive longer, allowing them to deal more damage. And while you care less about formations than a Spear build, you do still use some of them, which Skeletons help you to more easily set up.",
					"Damage-dealers and a bit of support. Obviously every tank would like a bit of support for healing, and as you're going to be more focused on mitigating incoming damage to the party, you do need allies whose primary aim is killing enemies.",
					"An example of an ideal four-character party for a Tank build would be something like: Ranged+Healing Drifter, Skeleton Swarm Boneshaper, Ranged Deathwalker, and Banner Spear."

Getting the Regenerate up before you rest will lead to this typically healing around 4 total hit points, which is a big deal for a tank (with that plus a long rest you may very well get back to full, which is important to continuing to tank effectively).</p>",

Normally, it's best to avoid unnecessary hits, even as a tank, so if you and your party can position such that most of the enemies won't reach you on round 1, then you're better off going at 83, letting the enemies approach, and then attacking. If the enemies will reach your party no matter what on round 1, then it's better to get the Shield up before they hit. If Javelin won't have enough range in that case or might not be fast enough (when facing very fast enemies), you can substitute Set for the Charge on top here."

For this action to be worth playing, you really need to heal at least two allies, at which point it's already very good with a net of positive four hit points, on top of dealing with a variety of negative conditions that are removed by healing (also note that you don't suffer any damage when you remove Poison from an ally). Additionally, a ranged/support Banner Spear will likely not take many hits but has a large pool of hit points to draw from, meaning the cost here is often insignificant, making this even better.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action is also incredibly useful. At the very least, it's pretty much always going to be a pre-castable Disarm, which as a non-loss bottom is great. But obviously the real value here is having an ally whose movement you control precisely who acts immediately before your turn each round, moving into position to help you set up your AoE patterns. At lower player counts or in parties without melee allies, if you're playing for a melee focus, you should consider that keeping this summon active is mandatory. And even when you have allies who can, in theory, help you, they may not always be willing to. Accordingly, look to play this bottom action as early as you can and resummon it when necessary if it dies.",

And while there is a condition on it, this is still one of your easier patterns to set up (remember that you can always mirror, flip, and rotate these patterns). So great payoff for little setup? Yes, please! What's the downside? Well, the downside is that the bottom action on this card is also incredible and deprives you of the top.",

Quite simply: that is difficult to do while also moving as much as you need to in order to effectively tank or be a melee damage-dealer, which is why this will mostly just be used in a ranged/support build, outside of scenarios that take place entirely in a single room.</p>"

					"bottom": "The bottom is meant to help you set up your AoEs by pulling an enemy into the requisite hex while you have the rest of the pattern set up. This does sometimes work in practice, but the Move 1 is still very limiting and makes it harder to use than something like Combined Effort's bottom. Bonus movement boots would help a lot here but jump boots are essential on a melee Banner Spear, which makes this remaining at a true Move 1 sting.",
					"overall": "Javelin is a solid filler card for most builds but a core card for a ranged/support Banner Spear.<p>If you have access to enhancement, this is a good place to stick a cheap +1 Move enhancement, which can make this bottom a lot more consistently useful.</p>"

At that point it's a solid action but nothing really incredible. Obviously if you have the persistent Shield 1 from Unbreakable Wall, then the synergy with Disadvantage is solid, and that gives you a good turn that combines offense and defence.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action promises a tremendous amount of Shield but is quite difficult to use. You lack top movement, which means you need to already be in position to use this from the round before. That's not necessarily difficult, but the difficult part is that it typically involves you sprinting to the front line to make sure the ranged enemies will be attacking you next round. The problem with that is that there will often also be melee enemies, and moving to the front and then not moving for the round is going to lead to getting hit by them, which you could often have avoided by just moving more safely. So overall, the bottom has incredible potential (get up to Shield 3 for the round and just shrug off all of the ranged attacks in the room) but is pretty difficult to use effectively on any consistent basis.",

Of course, that is a reasonably sized 'if', as this is one of your more difficult ally positioning requirements to pull off. If the Reinforcements are alive, it shouldn't be too difficult to make this work. Without them, you'll need an ally to stand in a specific spot for you, but then face some issues with initiative such that 06 is too fast and your ally won't be there in time but 32 or 67 are obviously too slow. So your best bet is certainly the Reinforcements or otherwise a very speedy ally like a Blinkblade.",
					"bottom": "The good news is that the bottom action is a very spammable and welcome Move 4, one of only two at level 1, meaning we'll always be happy to have this card around, and when the top lines up well against the right types of enemies, you'll get an amazing payoff at very little opportunity cost.",

If you're playing with a Banner, you'll need this to move the Banner through the scenario. If you're focusing on AoEs, you'll want to use this to move an ally into position on the same turn you use a top AoE action.",

				{
					"id": "setforthecharge",
					"top": "The top action is passable if you're playing the tanking persistent loss. It should never really be a focus, but there are a couple of reasons you might play it: you can't or don't want to get all the way to the enemies to attack or you're facing enemies where direct damage is more profitable than attacking (typically enemies with high Shield or Retaliate values).",

					"top": "The top action is theoretically very powerful but is by far the most difficult pattern we have at level 1. Jump boots can help a reasonable amount (if you have an ally adjacent to an enemy you can use a Move 4 bottom with the boots to go to the other side and fulfil the pattern) but even then it can be difficult, you won't always have them available, and that will often put you in a very dangerous position. Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss. And in that case, being your highest single-target damaging attack ability certainly sits well. But most of the time, I'd just recommend not trying to play around the top.",
					"bottom": "The bottom, on the other hand, is a very solid loot action. You need supplies for Frosthaven and this can get you them. The bottom would be much better with movement boots, which you won't have on a melee Banner Spear but can pick up in a ranged/support build (of course, if you're already in melee, it's easier to move with this to pick up the loot).",

					"id": "regroup",
					"top": "In between rooms this is a nice top action, and regenerate works well before a long rest as it clears Poison prior to the heal.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is fairly useless outside a Banner build, where you need all of the tools you can get to move your Banner from room to room, and a granted Move 3 is better than a Move 2. The significance of this action for the build is a big reason why the build is more ranged focused: you need to play this action once each rest cycle, and it's much easier to play it on a turn where you're performing a ranged attack or a heal than a melee attack.",
					"overall": "Regroup is another filler card for most builds although is still less valuable in that role than something like Javelin. It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter. Here, that's not really the case for any tanking or melee builds, as this lacks movement while also not having excellent initiative. Typically, something like Combined Effort will be significantly more convenient to use."
				},
				{
					"id": "resolvedcourage",
					"top": "To start, the top's pattern is typically significantly easier to pull off than the similar-but-different Tip of the Spear. It's also worth noting that this top pairs very well with summoning the Reinforcements in combat. You can play that bottom action and then have the pattern for this top set up immediately in the same round. This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies. It is theoretically possible to engineer a situation where you're able to run in late, then do this top, then run away the following round, but it requires some really precise positioning from your allies and the monsters such that I wouldn't fixate on it.</p>",
					"bottom": "Then the bottom is just a nice value action. It's not anything amazing, but being able to play this card for the bottom action to ensure you go before some monsters, and then still getting some bonus damage out of the deal is pretty sweet. The most obvious combo at level 1 is certainly with Unbreakable Wall, which both has more forgiving targeting to accommodate not moving, and also more possible targets. Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well. And lastly, don't forget to check what your allies are doing on rounds when you play this: it might be worth using this bottom after your attack for the turn if you have something like a nearby Deathwalker or Geminate ally performing a big AoE attack.",
					"overall": "Resolved Courage is an excellent card and definitely my favourite of Banner Spear's 'X' cards. It kind of has it all: strong top attack that's not too difficult to pull off, nice value bottom action, and excellent initiative."
				},
				{
					"id": "incendiarythrow",
					"top": "The top action has quite a lot of potential but does have some drawbacks. First of all, you simply cannot use this in situations where a -1 would yield no Wound because that's just too likely of a blowout. Accordingly, you need to increase the base attack value to 2, which can be done with the Banner of Strength or Resolved Courage's bottom action. Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there. Obviously you need to be mindful of scenarios with large numbers of enemies with Shield, where this is again more likely to deal no damage. Which is unfortunately because Wound is typically very good against shielded enemies.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, I'm not really sure what to make of the bottom. I've used it a bit and it's fine but it's pretty risky and doesn't have a lot of movement. I think it's fine to just throw down in some single-room extremely high tempo scenarios as a fire-and-forget bottom loss that will help out for a few turns and then eat some attacks and die, but I wouldn't really recommend worrying about it beyond that (or otherwise just for two much-needed experience on a Banner build as a throwaway loss at the end of the scenario).",

				{
					"id": "drivinginspiration",
					"top": "If you have the Banner of Strength out, the top is actually very good. When you're playing a ranged character who has some valuable non-move bottom actions like repositioning the Banner or summoning a sacrificial Reinforcement, Attack 3, Range 4 with advantage may honestly even be better than Attack 4, Range 3. Either way, you'll be happy to have them both.<p>For most builds, unless you have an ally who really needs the Light, the top just doesn't pack enough punch to justify.</p>",
					"bottom": "The Banner on the bottom is strong, its biggest drawback is just not really being as strong or essential as Banner of Strength while being another persistent loss on a 10-card class. Going down to 9 cards is perfectly viable in an average scenario, but going down to 8 cards and also having to transport both Banners through the scenario is just not going to be worth it for this Banner's added bonuses. Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).",

					"top": "The biggest frustration people have with this card is thinking they should hit two targets with it most of the time and when they don't, it's a disappointment. Not at all! While you can occasionally hit two targets thanks to your Jump boots, the vast, vast majority of uses for this top action should be a single Attack 4, Wound with a targeting pattern identical to Rallying Cry. And that's still very good! Combined Effort is an excellent top and the only thing keeping us from using it more is the bottom, but now you can have Combined Effort top and bottom, effectively.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action here is just a really convenient healing package that you can easily use when moving from room to room.",
					"overall": "Meat Grinder is a very nice package of a card.<p>Either you find an opportunity to use the top action in combat, or you still have the card in hand afterwards out of combat and you can get a reasonable amount of free healing. A great deal either way.</p>"

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is kind of a budget Regroup - while the added range and ally are nice if you're concerned with helping out your teammates, the reduced movement when doing something like moving a Banner is significantly worse. Of course, if you're moving Banners, even a budget Regroup is still a welcome addition.",

Even if you only hit a single enemy, you're still getting two Attack, Poison, four Healing, and an experience. And it's not very difficult to hit two enemies most of the time.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, is rather niche. It helps to enable a really powerful combo at level 9 and otherwise can just be thrown down in single-room defence scenarios. But otherwise, if you're focused on using Banners, Banner of Strength is going to give you more value that's also easier to use most of the time. While Shield 1 against all enemies attacks is inherently more powerful than +1 Attack on one attack per character, the restriction of needing to keep this adjacent to whoever is taking those attacks for it to be effective is just too much work for it to be worth it in most scenarios.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is just great though - you'll be happy to have this action every rest cycle. You actually lack a late initiative big move (the 67 on Tip of the Spear is not late enough to be reliable), so this fills that hole while providing a bunch of bonuses. The AoE Muddle lends itself well to AoEing a group of enemies who won't all die next round, and the Air is extremely free to power up Deflecting Manoeuvre.",

So yeah, if you take this card, you take it for the bottom action, which you'll be more than happy to use every single rest cycle, and then maybe in one out of every five times you play this card, you'll be able to set up the top and get an amazing payoff.</p>"

It's less that you're going to somehow put yourself in the middle of 5-6 enemies with an ally, and more having three extra hexes gives you more flexibility for targeting and will on average net you one additional target. Definitely a reasonable upgrade. Of course, that's not really what makes the card appealing.",

Between Explosive Epicenter and Boldening Blow, you have enough granted movement by now to make this happen. Unfortunately, there's often going to be a pretty real drawback as well - frequently one of your two allies that helps you with this pattern is going to be the Reinforcement. It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up. If you don't have enough melee allies who are consistently around you, then it's not going to be worth it. And while the payoffs seem like exactly what a tank would want, the tank build just isn't set up to provide enough movement to make this happen regularly (and even then, you'd be putting the allies you're tanking for in pretty risky spots to get the payoff).",
					"bottom": "The better action on Barricade by a reasonable margin is the bottom. This Banner is incredibly powerful - it's just a free Disarm every single round as long as you can keep it next to someone who will get attacked at least once in the round. That's not very difficult to do. And then it has some nice synergies with self-damage, like the Boneshaper's level 6 summon that makes her suffer six damage. It's so easy to set this up to negate that and that's such a huge swing for the Boneshaper.",
					"overall": "Accordingly, what are the use cases for actually taking Barricade at 6?<p>If you're going to spend a lot of time at level 9. The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well. In any of these cases, just treat Bolstering Shout as Barricade for the rest of the guide.</p>"

The Reinforcement and the Bird can both help with this although we can't really count on both of them all of the time, so it's important to have at least one melee ally.

Fortunately, most of your granted movement has an extra target, so you can move this and a Banner through the scenario at the same time. And then it also adds a small amount of free mitigation as a bonus with the Muddle, which is far from necessary but certainly welcome.",

					"top": "This is the Resolved Courage pattern except with the gray and blue hex swapped. I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.",
					"bottom": "The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions. Now, how much better than Meat Grinder bottom is this really? Definitely better, although probably not the difference between level 2 and level 8 better. Although I think this says more about how great Meat Grinder bottom is at level 2 than necessarily being a condemnation of this at level 8. I'd take this at level 8 and always be happy to have this action. If Taunting Howl didn't exist.",

Here we get an excellent amount of movement (9 in total!) while also going at a speedy 11 initiative. It's everything you could ever want. Suddenly, setting up the top of Tri-Thrust doesn't seem so difficult. And right now, you're probably saying 'But Gripeaway, you skipped the top!' To which I'll just respond 'Did I?'",

					"bottom": "Fortunately, the bottom is excellent against enemies with Shield by virtue of being direct damage. It has huge range and a lot of health so it's unlikely to die and it's pretty likely to damage most enemies in most rounds of the scenario. While it might seem like it's not a big upgrade over Banner of Strength, it's worth considering the number of enemy turns vs ally turns. Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength. And by being at the start of each enemy's turn, you always get the damage at an effective time rather than relying on character initiative. The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.",

					"top": "Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.</p>",
					"bottom": "And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears. Of course, given the stamina you already lost from the beginning, this won't work for long, but obviously it's better than having the top of Hail of Spears and no Banners.",
					"overall": "Even with the absurdity of Take No Prisoners, Hail of Spears certainly holds its own and then some."

With enough melee space but also a bit of protection to set up, you'll offer similar damage to the best damage-dealing build on this class, with the upside of being protected from catastrophe by virtue of your summons being resummonable.",

At the same time, having one tanky melee ally can buy you time and space to get set up, so that's also welcome.",

With two movement, flying, and the aforementioned three range, it's likely to attack pretty much every turn. Attack 1 may not seem like a lot, but getting one every round of combat, especially when paired with your natural ability to Poison a lot of enemies, adds up to a ton of damage over the course of a scenario with very minimal upkeep. Additionally, having this on the board gives you a backup target for your summon control attacks if your skeletons all somehow get killed before your turn.",

And worst-case, if you bring this card and there doesn't end up being a need for the bottom, you're just stuck with the very good top action, so it's a pretty great deal.

That being said, it's not quite that simple as we do both need to give up a Skeleton and have the Skeleton in an appropriate location. Giving up a Skeleton can certainly be acceptable if you kill an enemy that would have killed the Skeleton anyway and with a big loss attack like this, that's not unrealistic. As for positioning the Skeleton, you'll most commonly want to combo this top with the bottom of Approach Oblivion. Regardless, the top of this card is not what makes me want to bring it.",
					"bottom": "It's also not necessarily the bottom action either. The bottom action is certainly interesting. Two AoE direct damage is quite good. The downside is that you're not super fast yourself with this (going at 21) so many of your allies will have gone before you. And all of your summons naturally go before you. So the greatest difficulty with this bottom is making sure you trigger it. Obviously you can set this up first then kill an enemy with a top command action - something like Command the Wretched - but 2-3 damage is often not going to be enough. Your melee allies also won't really appreciate triggering this for you. Of course, your summons are mostly melee but at the same time a 3-hp Skeleton and a 1-hp Skeleton are very similar in terms of effectiveness, so it's not the end of the world if they get a bit dinged up exploding some corpses. All-in-all, this is powerful and quite free to play but also harder to use than you would expect, making it fine but not great.",
					"overall": "Exploding Corpse is just fine.<p>We're not unhappy with this card just because of the initiative. At level 1, this is our second-fast initiative, just behind our 18. So while I'm not overly concerned about the value I'm going to get from the top action or bottom action here, just having this around to go at 21 initiative is going to be good enough, whether that's for a Move 2, to set up the bottom in the hopes of getting some free direct damage, or sometimes even to play the top. When you control 2-3 summons in addition to having your own turn, being able to go early in the round can be a huge swing, and definitely justifies making sure we bring some fast initiatives when we can.</p>"

Accordingly, it's not always easy for us to heal ourselves. Even this seemingly-mediocre self-heal is actually really, really welcome. Think about it like this: if you get an average of Heal 1.5 from this each rest cycle and you use it during six rest cycles, that's 4-5 additional Skeletons you'll be able to summon during the scenario. It really does add up. And don't overly focus on the bonus heal here, try to get it if you can, but the most important thing is just making sure you find the chance to play this more than anything, triggering the bonus regularly can be challenging.",

If you're desperate, sitting around at 1 or 2 hit points and you can't get anything going because you can't summon, you may be willing to play this with the level 1 summons sometimes. In those cases, it will be acceptable, although not exciting. Where this gets really interested is when you hit level 6 and can use this to negate the six damage, at which point you're looking at a loss Heal 10 self (or sometimes even Heal 14), which is certainly something this class can be in the market for. Unfortunately, by that time, you typically also already have a number of other losses you want to play, so I still only end up running that combo if my other losses don't look good in that scenario or the scenario is quite short.",

There's not much more to say about it than that: with one of your signature summons on top, a spammable and always-welcome Move 4 on bottom, and solid late initiative, this is definitely one of your best level 1 cards. The only catch with this card is that you need to be careful when evaluating your total movement for a scenario: obviously if you summon with the top action, you won't have access to this Move 4, so you need to consider that this won't be a big move ability for you as often as you think when building your hand."

But after the first two turns, I'd pretty much just ignore the top action and just keep this card around for the bottom and its initiative.",

First of all, this bottom is a net of three hit points and Dark as a bottom heal action, which is honestly amazing. The catch is that you have more difficulty healing yourself than most and if you're trying to summon numerous Skeletons, you have more need of hit points than most. Accordingly, while the effect is very powerful, it's merely an average action in Skeleton-based builds. For single-summon builds, where you don't summon many Skeletons, your hit points are a much less precious resource, and this functions more like a Heal 4 or 5, which is incredible.  It is, unfortunately, only let down by its terrible initiative, especially as you lack fast non-loss top combat actions at low level, meaning the turn you play this for its bottom action will usually be a risky one.",

Obviously it can work out, but all of this to say that Eternal Torment is just generally the better version, and it makes Dark to boot. Still, if you're more interested in having one summon attack often rather than summoning a large army of summons, this has what you need. And in the single-summon build, this top really is quite good: your summon moves for the turn, performs an Attack 3, then you command it to attack with this and it performs an Attack 4.

Skeletons are disposable so you don't care that much about making sure they don't get into bad spots. Accordingly, they may take some unnecessary punishment, but that's normally not the end of the world to you. Setting up a loss to keep them alive when they may waste some number of charges is not really super appealing, although obviously it can still be very good against bosses. Lastly, the initiative isn't particularly useful for the bottom, but being able to go late when you want your beefy loss summon to run up and hit an enemy is nice, so the initiative can be useful for the top.",

The problem is that the bottom is just kind of awkward for a number of reasons. You can't perfectly control where your summons go, making an AoE like this hard to aim. When the AoE is a top action, you can use a bottom move command to get the summon into position, but the only way to get this into position with a top action is to use something like Command the Wretched, but then you're also attacking before poisoning, which is again awkward. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, you don't have top in-combat actions with good initiative, meaning you'll need to do this late, but obviously it's better to poison enemies early in a round so that your party can take advantage of it. All-in-all, this is a very powerful effect for a level 2 non-loss action, but the power level is significantly balanced out by the awkwardness of using it.",

If your Skeletons are going to take a significant number of hits in the scenario because you don't have allies on the front line absorbing hits for them, this will pretty much always pay for itself to an excellent degree. Now tanking hits with Skeletons feels great - you're getting disarms and retaliate damage from your summons.

This persistent loss is the basis for an entire build on this class and I think that build is very, very good in many parties.",

If you have access to that, you're already pretty close to getting there with this.</li> <li>A +1 Range enhancement on the bottom of Damned Horde. That enhancement makes it pretty realistic to get two more curses per rest cycle.</li> <li>An ally (or allies) who curse. Obviously if we can't really get there ourself, if we have some help to bridge the gap between ~5 curses and 8-10, we can justify this.</li> <p>If you have any two of the three above, I would seriously consider taking Critical Failure and building around the bottom in a Skeleton Swarm build.</p>"

Getting to go this early in the round and guarantee that one of your summons will survive at least one hit is something every summoner would be happy to have. Obviously it does come with a serious cost - at least for a Skeleton build - but as it's the same cost as just summoning another Skeleton, this is still like getting to summon an in-position Skeleton with a bottom action, which is great.

And shield is common enough (and a significant enough issue for Skeleton builds) that pierce as also welcome damage. This just makes Skeletons a lot better at what they do, which is essentially what you do, all at the cost of going from 12 cards to 11, which is a steal.

The movement is more difficult to evaluate generally and that's just a case-by-case thing. All of this to say: while Solid Bones is amazing to have active, you shouldn't just throw it up every single scenario without thinking about it - there will be some scenarios (or points in a build) where it's not worth playing, even if not many.

You'll definitely want to try to grab some healing items or if your allies can give you a timely Ward before you do this, it would be great. If you don't have access to much healing or Ward in your available items and allies, you should seriously consider using Life in Death's bottom then to help pay for this (activate that bottom the turn you summon this the first time, then try to do just one more summon with it and then this again if you can, although even if you just use it for this and then two normal summons that's also okay).",

You can only have one enemy marked at once, so when you attack a different enemy, you must choose (before pulling your modifier) whether to move the mark or leave it on the previous target. Remember that when performing multi-target attacks, you can choose the order of targets; whenever practical, you should choose to first attack targets that have a chance of dying, so that you can generate shadows from the kills and leave the last enemy marked.

We're basically never playing Eclipse's top action anymore, but it's still something we can drop in the last room for some free XP with Anger of the Dead, and our best movement option when we don't need to teleport. As a result, I'd typically cut Black Barrage here; however, if you know you won't be walking very much, then you can instead cut Eclipse, shift Black Barrage to an attack, and play Forceful Spirits as a teleport. Forceful Spirits is really the only reason we're bothering to position ourself anymore, so if you aren't using that then two teleports a cycle should be more than enough.

In particular, I would recommend taking Medium if you took Restless Spirits back at level two, since that's something more to do on bottom.</p><p>Hungry Grasps does exactly the same thing as Forceful Spirits, except it doesn't require us to position ourself or to consume dark. Still, Forceful Spirits is a powerful attack and our best teleport, so we'll cut Sunless Apparition instead. Now that we have Vengeful Storm, we don't really need the summon to find high value from our shadows; it is slightly better than one extra attack three, but not enough extra to cost us a whole extra turn.</p>"

				"body": [
					"The Banner build emphasizes the Banners aspect of the Banner Spear, planning on deploying a Banner on the first round of the scenario and keeping it in the middle of the group till the end. Because the build needs to use its bottom actions to shepherd the otherwise immobile Banner through the scenario, this build will lean more heavily on ranged attacks and ranged support actions, rather than melee attack abilities which require more personal movement.<p>This build is a bit light on experience gain. At the start we don't have many non-loss xp generators so At All Costs is important to play each rest cycle for its experience generation on either half.</p>"
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Your group's coordination and communication is the number one determining factor in whether a Banner build can work for you. In Frosthaven, you can freely discuss everything except giving specific names or numbers. That means you can show precise hexes you need people to occupy, or where you're going, etc. If your group prefers to avoid this sort of communication, or if your allies prefer to focus largely on their own character and are unlikely to work with you to set up some formations, you would be much better off playing a Spear build.",
					"You have a large number of attackers in your group. Typically this means a party of at least three characters, or otherwise a summoner class like the Boneshaper who summons a number of additional attackers."
				],
				"preferences": [
					"Boneshaper. The Banner of Strength can only trigger once per turn, which means someone like an AoE attacker or someone who makes a number of attacks in a turn like a Blinkblade doesn't benefit that greatly. But each of the Boneshaper's summons have an individual turn, which means they each get the bonus attack. If the Boneshaper has two Skeletons attacking, and then grants an additional attack on her turn, that would mean the Banner of Strength gives +3 attack for just a single character, which is amazing.",

Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss.

It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter.

This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies.

Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well.

Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there.

Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).",

It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up. If you don't have enough melee allies who are consistently around you, then it's not going to be worth it.

The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well.

I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.",
					"bottom": "The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions.

It has huge range and a lot of health so it's unlikely to die and it's pretty likely to damage most enemies in most rounds of the scenario. While it might seem like it's not a big upgrade over Banner of Strength, it's worth considering the number of enemy turns vs ally turns. Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength. And by being at the start of each enemy's turn, you always get the damage at an effective time rather than relying on character initiative. The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.",

					"top": "Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.</p>",
					"bottom": "And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears.

You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when leveling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.",

That means you can show precise hexes you need people to occupy, or where you're going, etc. If your group prefers to avoid this sort of communication, or if your allies prefer to focus largely on their own character and are unlikely to work with you to set up some formations, you would be much better off playing a Banner build.",
					"You have a number of melee allies, whether melee characters like a Drifter or Blinkblade, or someone who summons a swarm of melee allies like a Boneshaper.

But obviously the real value here is having an ally whose movement you control precisely who acts immediately before your turn each round, moving into position to help you set up your AoE patterns. At lower player counts or in parties without melee allies, if you're playing for a melee focus, you should consider that keeping this summon active is mandatory.

If the Reinforcements are alive, it shouldn't be too difficult to make this work. Without them, you'll need an ally to stand in a specific spot for you, but then face some issues with initiative such that 06 is too fast and your ally won't be there in time but 32 or 67 are obviously too slow.

Jump boots can help a reasonable amount (if you have an ally adjacent to an enemy you can use a Move 4 bottom with the boots to go to the other side and fulfil the pattern) but even then it can be difficult, you won't always have them available, and that will often put you in a very dangerous position. Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss. And in that case, being your highest single-target damaging attack ability certainly sits well. But most of the time, I'd just recommend not trying to play around the top.",

					"overall": "Regroup is another filler card for most builds although is still less valuable in that role than something like Javelin. It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter. Here, that's not really the case for any tanking or melee builds, as this lacks movement while also not having excellent initiative. Typically, something like Combined Effort will be significantly more convenient to use."

It's also worth noting that this top pairs very well with summoning the Reinforcements in combat. You can play that bottom action and then have the pattern for this top set up immediately in the same round. This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies. It is theoretically possible to engineer a situation where you're able to run in late, then do this top, then run away the following round, but it requires some really precise positioning from your allies and the monsters such that I wouldn't fixate on it.</p>",

It's not anything amazing, but being able to play this card for the bottom action to ensure you go before some monsters, and then still getting some bonus damage out of the deal is pretty sweet. The most obvious combo at level 1 is certainly with Unbreakable Wall, which both has more forgiving targeting to accommodate not moving, and also more possible targets. Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well. And lastly, don't forget to check what your allies are doing on rounds when you play this: it might be worth using this bottom after your attack for the turn if you have something like a nearby Deathwalker or Geminate ally performing a big AoE attack.",

Accordingly, you need to increase the base attack value to 2, which can be done with the Banner of Strength or Resolved Courage's bottom action. Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there. Obviously you need to be mindful of scenarios with large numbers of enemies with Shield, where this is again more likely to deal no damage. Which is unfortunately because Wound is typically very good against shielded enemies.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, I'm not really sure what to make of the bottom. I've used it a bit and it's fine but it's pretty risky and doesn't have a lot of movement. I think it's fine to just throw down in some single-room extremely high tempo scenarios as a fire-and-forget bottom loss that will help out for a few turns and then eat some attacks and die, but I wouldn't really recommend worrying about it beyond that (or otherwise just for two much-needed experience on a Banner build as a throwaway loss at the end of the scenario).",

Either way, you'll be happy to have them both.<p>For most builds, unless you have an ally who really needs the Light, the top just doesn't pack enough punch to justify.</p>",
					"bottom": "The Banner on the bottom is strong, its biggest drawback is just not really being as strong or essential as Banner of Strength while being another persistent loss on a 10-card class. Going down to 9 cards is perfectly viable in an average scenario, but going down to 8 cards and also having to transport both Banners through the scenario is just not going to be worth it for this Banner's added bonuses. Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).",

Definitely a reasonable upgrade. Of course, that's not really what makes the card appealing.",

Between Explosive Epicenter and Boldening Blow, you have enough granted movement by now to make this happen. Unfortunately, there's often going to be a pretty real drawback as well - frequently one of your two allies that helps you with this pattern is going to be the Reinforcement. It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up. If you don't have enough melee allies who are consistently around you, then it's not going to be worth it. And while the payoffs seem like exactly what a tank would want, the tank build just isn't set up to provide enough movement to make this happen regularly (and even then, you'd be putting the allies you're tanking for in pretty risky spots to get the payoff).",
					"bottom": "The better action on Barricade by a reasonable margin is the bottom. This Banner is incredibly powerful - it's just a free Disarm every single round as long as you can keep it next to someone who will get attacked at least once in the round. That's not very difficult to do. And then it has some nice synergies with self-damage, like the Boneshaper's level 6 summon that makes her suffer six damage. It's so easy to set this up to negate that and that's such a huge swing for the Boneshaper.",
					"overall": "Accordingly, what are the use cases for actually taking Barricade at 6?<p>If you're going to spend a lot of time at level 9. The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well. In any of these cases, just treat Bolstering Shout as Barricade for the rest of the guide.</p>"

And beyond that, the bottom can also be used to pull enemies away from your fragile allies.",

I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.",
					"bottom": "The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions. Now, how much better than Meat Grinder bottom is this really? Definitely better, although probably not the difference between level 2 and level 8 better. Although I think this says more about how great Meat Grinder bottom is at level 2 than necessarily being a condemnation of this at level 8.

It has huge range and a lot of health so it's unlikely to die and it's pretty likely to damage most enemies in most rounds of the scenario.

Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength. And by being at the start of each enemy's turn, you always get the damage at an effective time rather than relying on character initiative. The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.",

					"top": "Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.</p>",
					"bottom": "And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears. Of course, given the stamina you already lost from the beginning, this won't work for long, but obviously it's better than having the top of Hail of Spears and no Banners.",

				"body": [
					"The single-summon build for the Boneshaper is probably the most traditional-Gloomhaven of the Boneshaper's builds, focused around getting out a strong loss melee summon and keeping it alive all scenario to deal damage. To keep it alive we'll need to use commanded movement, defensive tools to block damage (ability cards like Flesh Shield [level 4] or items like our starting item the Warden's Robes), and we'll even occasionally use Skeletons as decoys/buffers to draw enemy attacks such that our prized summon doesn't die."
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Your party typically lacks space in melee range of enemies. If you're playing in a larger party where your allies are mostly melee, you may find that it's difficult to have enough space next to enemies to deal damage with Skeletons. It will typically take two Skeletons to deal the damage of one loss melee summon so if you don't have that space, you'll be more effective focusing your attention on one, more effective, summon. It's worth noting that there are two types of melee allies. Some melee allies, like a Blinkblade, can kind of move all over the place and target any enemies. Allies like this don't really pose a problem because they can just fight the back line while you fight the front. On the other hand, melee Drifters or Bannerspears, for example, typically fight 'front-to-back,' which means that they kill what's directly in front of them until there's nothing else in front of them. You naturally also fight like this with your summons, so these are the types of allies who compete with you for space.",

				],
				"preferences": [
					"Bannerspear. Bannerspear + Boneshaper is known as the BS combo for a reason and they have excellent synergy in both directions on so many levels",
					"Having at least one tanky ally. You do want a dedicated tank who can absorb hits to keep your loss summon alive.",
					"A crowd of melee allies. The more melee allies you have, within reason, the less likely your summon will randomly die.",
					"An example of an ideal party for a single-summon Boneshaper would be something like: a melee and/or tanky Bannerspear, melee and/or tanky Drifter, Geminate/Blinkblade/ranged Deathwalker, and Boneshaper"

With two movement, flying, and the aforementioned three range, it's likely to attack pretty much every turn. Attack 1 may not seem like a lot, but getting one every round of combat, especially when paired with your natural ability to Poison a lot of enemies, adds up to a ton of damage over the course of a scenario with very minimal upkeep. Additionally, having this on the board gives you a backup target for your summon control attacks if your skeletons all somehow get killed before your turn.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also quite solid as a pretty free source of fire-and-forget damage. Admittedly, while you can just set it up and wait to get paid off whenever, it's significantly better when it triggers against certain enemy types (typically those with higher shield values). The worst part of the bottom is that you can't have both the bottom and the top.",

The Wraith is pretty bad against enemies with shield, while the bottom is very good against them. So lots of shield? Use the bottom. Little-to-no shield? Get that Wraith out there early. Either way, we're loving this card.</p>"

So I mostly wouldn't worry about the top loss when considering this card and maybe it will pop up as being helpful here or there if you've already brought the card for its bottom action.",

Pairing a single-use loss with a spammable top means that we can have access to this loss for when we need at essentially zero opportunity cost.

And worst-case, if you bring this card and there doesn't end up being a need for the bottom, you're just stuck with the very good top action, so it's a pretty great deal.

Giving up a Skeleton can certainly be acceptable if you kill an enemy that would have killed the Skeleton anyway and with a big loss attack like this, that's not unrealistic. As for positioning the Skeleton, you'll most commonly want to combo this top with the bottom of Approach Oblivion. Regardless, the top of this card is not what makes me want to bring it.",
					"bottom": "It's also not necessarily the bottom action either. The bottom action is certainly interesting. Two AoE direct damage is quite good. The downside is that you're not super fast yourself with this (going at 21) so many of your allies will have gone before you. And all of your summons naturally go before you. So the greatest difficulty with this bottom is making sure you trigger it. Obviously you can set this up first then kill an enemy with a top command action - something like Command the Wretched - but 2-3 damage is often not going to be enough. Your melee allies also won't really appreciate triggering this for you. Of course, your summons are mostly melee but at the same time a 3-hp Skeleton and a 1-hp Skeleton are very similar in terms of effectiveness, so it's not the end of the world if they get a bit dinged up exploding some corpses. All-in-all, this is powerful and quite free to play but also harder to use than you would expect, making it fine but not great.",
					"overall": "Exploding Corpse is just fine.<p>We're not unhappy with this card just because of the initiative. At level 1, this is our second-fast initiative, just behind our 18. So while I'm not overly concerned about the value I'm going to get from the top action or bottom action here, just having this around to go at 21 initiative is going to be good enough, whether that's for a Move 2, to set up the bottom in the hopes of getting some free direct damage, or sometimes even to play the top. When you control 2-3 summons in addition to having your own turn, being able to go early in the round can be a huge swing, and definitely justifies making sure we bring some fast initiatives when we can.</p>"

Think about it like this: if you get an average of Heal 1.5 from this each rest cycle and you use it during six rest cycles, that's 4-5 additional Skeletons you'll be able to summon during the scenario. It really does add up. And don't overly focus on the bonus heal here, try to get it if you can, but the most important thing is just making sure you find the chance to play this more than anything, triggering the bonus regularly can be challenging.",

Movement that also moves one of your summons is just great.

If you're desperate, sitting around at 1 or 2 hit points and you can't get anything going because you can't summon, you may be willing to play this with the level 1 summons sometimes. In those cases, it will be acceptable, although not exciting. Where this gets really interested is when you hit level 6 and can use this to negate the six damage, at which point you're looking at a loss Heal 10 self (or sometimes even Heal 14), which is certainly something this class can be in the market for. Unfortunately, by that time, you typically also already have a number of other losses you want to play, so I still only end up running that combo if my other losses don't look good in that scenario or the scenario is quite short.",

There's not much more to say about it than that: with one of your signature summons on top, a spammable and always-welcome Move 4 on bottom, and solid late initiative, this is definitely one of your best level 1 cards. The only catch with this card is that you need to be careful when evaluating your total movement for a scenario: obviously if you summon with the top action, you won't have access to this Move 4, so you need to consider that this won't be a big move ability for you as often as you think when building your hand."

With your hand size you can certainly afford it and it's often better to play a loss like this than try to be greedy, play too slow, take a bunch of damage and be stuck unable to summon afterwards. But after the first two turns, I'd pretty much just ignore the top action and just keep this card around for the bottom and its initiative.",

Dark Tidings has a better top loss and I'd rather a Move 4 rather than this Move 3-5, but initiative is king. The 26 initiative here may not seem great in the abstract but this is our third-fastest initiative at level 1 and we're a 12-card class. Additionally, Exploding Corpse isn't always easy to use.

And remember, both effects are more useful for you than many other classes: you'll almost always have allies to strengthen because you have your summons, and Poison adds a significant amount of damage for you as you make a lot of smaller hits with your Skeletons.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also very good, although more so for one specific build. First of all, this bottom is a net of three hit points and Dark as a bottom heal action, which is honestly amazing. The catch is that you have more difficulty healing yourself than most and if you're trying to summon numerous Skeletons, you have more need of hit points than most. Accordingly, while the effect is very powerful, it's merely an average action in Skeleton-based builds. For single-summon builds, where you don't summon many Skeletons, your hit points are a much less precious resource, and this functions more like a Heal 4 or 5, which is incredible.  It is, unfortunately, only let down by its terrible initiative, especially as you lack fast non-loss top combat actions at low level, meaning the turn you play this for its bottom action will usually be a risky one.",

Obviously it can work out, but all of this to say that Eternal Torment is just generally the better version, and it makes Dark to boot. Still, if you're more interested in having one summon attack often rather than summoning a large army of summons, this has what you need. And in the single-summon build, this top really is quite good: your summon moves for the turn, performs an Attack 3, then you command it to attack with this and it performs an Attack 4. Attack 7 non-loss total for the turn at level 2 (the single-summon build goes from level 2) is pretty excellent.",

Skeletons are disposable so you don't care that much about making sure they don't get into bad spots. Accordingly, they may take some unnecessary punishment, but that's normally not the end of the world to you. Setting up a loss to keep them alive when they may waste some number of charges is not really super appealing, although obviously it can still be very good against bosses. Lastly, the initiative isn't particularly useful for the bottom, but being able to go late when you want your beefy loss summon to run up and hit an enemy is nice, so the initiative can be useful for the top.",

					"bottom": "The bottom doesn't really matter, at least not until later, if you're taking this card for a single-summon build, and I don't think it's enough to take this for a Skeleton-based build. The problem is that the bottom is just kind of awkward for a number of reasons. You can't perfectly control where your summons go, making an AoE like this hard to aim. When the AoE is a top action, you can use a bottom move command to get the summon into position, but the only way to get this into position with a top action is to use something like Command the Wretched, but then you're also attacking before poisoning, which is again awkward. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, you don't have top in-combat actions with good initiative, meaning you'll need to do this late, but obviously it's better to poison enemies early in a round so that your party can take advantage of it. All-in-all, this is a very powerful effect for a level 2 non-loss action, but the power level is significantly balanced out by the awkwardness of using it.",

If your Skeletons are going to take a significant number of hits in the scenario because you don't have allies on the front line absorbing hits for them, this will pretty much always pay for itself to an excellent degree. Now tanking hits with Skeletons feels great - you're getting disarms and retaliate damage from your summons.

This persistent loss is the basis for an entire build on this class and I think that build is very, very good in many parties.",

Obviously if we can't really get there ourself, if we have some help to bridge the gap between ~5 curses and 8-10, we can justify this.</li> <p>If you have any two of the three above, I would seriously consider taking Critical Failure and building around the bottom in a Skeleton Swarm build.</p>"

Obviously it does come with a serious cost - at least for a Skeleton build - but as it's the same cost as just summoning another Skeleton, this is still like getting to summon an in-position Skeleton with a bottom action, which is great.

And shield is common enough (and a significant enough issue for Skeleton builds) that pierce as also welcome damage. This just makes Skeletons a lot better at what they do, which is essentially what you do, all at the cost of going from 12 cards to 11, which is a steal. The biggest downside is just needing another turn to set this up as it competes with Skeleton summons directly for your top action economy (another reason Grave Digging and, to a lesser extent, Bone Dagger are looking so good).",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is just a fine spammable action for any scenario where you don't want to play the top or don't want to play the top right away. Why wouldn't you play the top? Well, if all the enemies are likely to hit for four or more damage, the added hit points aren't likely to do much. If there's no shield, obviously the pierce doesn't do anything. The movement is more difficult to evaluate generally and that's just a case-by-case thing. All of this to say: while Solid Bones is amazing to have active, you shouldn't just throw it up every single scenario without thinking about it - there will be some scenarios (or points in a build) where it's not worth playing, even if not many. And for those times, the bottom is fine, if not nearly as good as the bottom of Unforgivable Methods.",

Additionally, it can even save us some stamina by letting us have more Skeletons out for less active cards at the end of a rest cycle. Now obviously this great power also comes with great cost and losing six hit points is a huge cost. You'll definitely want to try to grab some healing items or if your allies can give you a timely Ward before you do this, it would be great. If you don't have access to much healing or Ward in your available items and allies, you should seriously consider using Life in Death's bottom then to help pay for this (activate that bottom the turn you summon this the first time, then try to do just one more summon with it and then this again if you can, although even if you just use it for this and then two normal summons that's also okay).",
					"bottom": "The bottom… just can't compare. At least not for a Skeleton-based build. For a single-summon build, this is just a substantially better version of a card we're already using in Approach Oblivion, so there it's obviously not bad, if nothing special. And for either a single-summon build or Skeleton Swarm build that goes the route of the Bone Ball, this bottom can be useful after the Bone Ball has been filled with Skeletons, to make it move for your command attack actions.",
					"overall": "Well, we thought that level 5 would be a high point for Skeleton builds with Solid Bones, and then came along Rotting Multitude. Rotting Multitude's top summon action is crazy good. By far one of the biggest weaknesses of the Boneshaper is tempo and the amount of time it takes us to get set up or to re-setup after our summons die."

And the Dark generated here also just pairs very well with Wretched Command as a follow-up against any enemies with shield.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile the bottom is just a solid Boneshaper attack for when you don't need or want to command your summon or if you really need the poison (and get a nice free curse in the mix).",
					"overall": "Twisted Decree is also just quite solid in the same way that Wretched Command was solid at level 1.<p>Good top action, good bottom action, and a good late initiative makes for an overall good card. Not quite on the same level as Rotting Multitude for the builds that want Skeletons, but a welcome addition nonetheless.</p>"

As I said, the Boneshaper struggles with the time it takes to set up and then re-setup and Recycled Limbs can help enormously with the latter. With a single Skeleton summon active, you can get back another (one of the two being Rotting Multitude) and then immediately get three Move 3, Attack 3 Pierce 1's. Getting that amount of immediate tempo while also recreating your summon presence on the board all with a single action is quite the useful tool to have, even if it's hopefully something you won't necessarily need or want to use every scenario. The most difficult part of the top is just getting both the elements at the right moment for when you need this - it's something you can do, but it'll be much more smooth if you have an item or ally to help out a bit.",
					"bottom": "And while you're waiting to need the top, the bottom is just a great consistent value engine. First of all, note that this triggers on the death of any 'figure', which means it triggers on your Skeletons dying. Accordingly, this will easily trigger three times per rest cycle, making this action three instances of Heal 2, Range 3 on an ally that you can just fire-and-forget. And it also makes Dark, which is always welcome. It might not seem impressive, but trust me that once you've played with it some amount, the amount of healing your party gets from this one card for such a low cost is really very welcome (this helps justify asking any allies who can heal to target you so much - now you can give something back!).",

The biggest drawback to this top action is simply that it competes with your Skeleton summoning, which are also top setup actions. Naturally some combination of the two works quite well because once you have some Skeletons on the board, a significantly increased miss chance for the enemies means your Skeletons will stick around longer and be more effective.",
					"bottom": "Soul Claim bottom is just a significantly upgraded version of the acceptable-but-not-impressive Bone Dagger bottom: no range requirement, we get the summon in what is typically a more useful position, and we get to set this up with better initiative.",
					"overall": "Soul Claim doesn't offer anything quite as impressive as Recycled Limbs but just gives two decent actions with a good initiative, and if you've learned anything by now, that's something we're often in for.<p>When you have Soul Claim in your hand, there's really not a dominant side that you'll end up using more often than not, you'll just have a nice filler card that can provide you with a top or bottom action carrying reasonable initiative whenever you want - and there's a lot to be said for a card like that.</p>"

What's even more awesome is that it's not only an awesome design but it's also really, really good. It does demand a lot of work though: you need to keep it safe and sufficiently fed, which requires a ton of summon command movement both to keep it in a good spot and to get stray Skeletons to join the Horde. But once you reach a comfortable stack of tokens on this, it just destroys enemies while also being pretty well-protected from disaster. The biggest catch is that you just need time and space to set up.",
					"bottom": "I'm not even sure this card has a bottom action. In truth, it's okay-ish for a single-summon build if for some reason you don't feel that you can summon the top right away, but the Bone Ball waits for no man (or aesther).",
					"overall": "BONE BALL!<p>Bone Ball note: Skeletons will essentially treat the hex occupied by the Bone Ball as an unoccupied hex and if their movement, following normal focus rules, ends in that hex then they will be eaten.

The Dark consumption here isn't something you really need to play around - sure it makes the curses more likely to be drawn, but it's not really enough of a difference that I'll care that much to set it up in advance, with the exception being on the Bone Wall build, where the added mitigation matters a lot more because of the goal of our build. Even more than that, the muddle is especially useful if you did choose to play around Critical Failure (level 4) as it will keep ranged enemies from backing away from your Skeletons before attacking, meaning your Skeletons will get to attack them if they draw a curse.",

Even without Earth, getting a Move 3, Heal 3, Range 3 targeting an ally is just always welcome, and when you can toss them a Ward too it's even better.<p>I'm never looking to pay too much attention to this bottom because of how powerful the top is, but if you somehow get to the end of a rest cycle without finding a time to use the top, you'll happily throw down the bottom for some free value, and that's just a great way to put together a card.</p>",

Well, that's all over now. Skeletons, lots and lots of Skeletons, all for free! Again, this is a bit broken, but it's a kind of broken I can get behind.",

					"The Bone Wall build for the Boneshaper is similar to the Skeleton Swarm build, only focused on accepting that our summons will take hits. The Skeleton Swarm build would honestly prefer its summons to never get hit, or almost never, given the choice - they're just there to deal damage by attacking. In this build, because we know our summons will get smacked around quite a bit, we're going to lean into it and actually benefit from our Skeletons getting hit. Instead of a pure damage-dealer, we're going to function as a hybrid between a damage-dealer and a tank."
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Your party doesn't have anyone who can stand on the front line and take some hits for the team? Well, now you're the front line. You can build around letting your Skeletons take some reasonable number of hits per scenario and actually profit from it pretty substantially, making you a reasonably-effective tank in addition to a damage-dealer.",
					"Your allies really benefit from poison. This build may be one of the best builds for any class in any Gloomhaven game at applying poison to most enemies in the scenario. So if you have allies who make a large number of small attacks (like some Blinkblade builds do, for example), this build may be your best way of being effective for the party."

				"preferences": [
					"Bannerspear. Bannerspear + Boneshaper is known as the BS combo for a reason and they have excellent synergy in both directions on so many levels.",
					"A party without a dedicated tank. If you have a tank in your party who's really serious about tanking and their tankiness, your Skeletons may get hit less than you'd like (and less than would justify playing this build over one of the other builds).",
					"A healer. Like any tank in the game, you'd love to have someone healing you. In your case, that's to be able to more freely summon Skeletons whenever you want, but it's still adding a ton of effectiveness to your build and thus the party.",
					"An example of an ideal party with a Bone Wall Boneshaper would be something like: a Banner-focused Bannerspear, a ranged + healing Drifter (any version of a healing Drifter is good but ranged makes a larger number of smaller attacks), and a Blinkblade."

With two movement, flying, and the aforementioned three range, it's likely to attack pretty much every turn. Attack 1 may not seem like a lot, but getting one every round of combat, especially when paired with your natural ability to Poison a lot of enemies, adds up to a ton of damage over the course of a scenario with very minimal upkeep. Additionally, having this on the board gives you a backup target for your summon control attacks if your skeletons all somehow get killed before your turn.",

So I mostly wouldn't worry about the top loss when considering this card and maybe it will pop up as being helpful here or there if you've already brought the card for its bottom action.",
					"bottom": "The bottom of Approach Oblivion is the real reason to bring this card. Some builds will want so much summon movement that they're willing to bring this card along just for that.

It's much, much less likely that we'll plan on using this as our attack for the turn and we won't be able to hit anything because of what happened before we went. The Dark consumption for Pierce 2 is also a very welcome bonus as we often struggle to deal with enemies with shield, especially at lower levels, and we have a couple of easy sources of Dark already at level 1.",
					"bottom": "The bottom loss is exactly how you want to set up single-use loss actions. Pairing a single-use loss with a spammable top means that we can have access to this loss for when we need at essentially zero opportunity cost. And this bottom loss is perfectly fine - an Attack 5 is certainly not a worthwhile loss as a top action, but as a bottom action at level 1 on a 12-card class, it's definitely acceptable. You'll be more than happy to use this on boss fights, in desperate situations, or at the end of scenarios. And do note that this can grant the attack to any ally, not just a summon.",

The limitations against the effectiveness of these summons, aside from the monsters themselves, is just your hit points (which are not very easy for you to replenish yourself) and enough space on the board for them to hit.

Long gone are the base Gloomhaven times of easily stacking 10 curses in the enemy attack modifier deck. As you have no top movement and you also don't typically even have significant personal positioning requirements (as you can command your summons from pretty much anywhere), it's not going to be common that you're within range 2 of two enemies. Most often, depending on my party and the scenario, I'll try to use this bottom action on turn 1 of a scenario and then rarely, if ever, play it after that. Of course, the top action is reason enough to bring this card, so we can focus on playing it for that and just be happy anytime we get to pull off the bottom with two targets.",

And yes, poisoning enemies is extremely valuable to you given the number of smaller attacks you're likely to make with your summons.",

Enemies with retaliate are the bane of most summons, especially melee summons .

So we'll be bringing this card to any scenario with a reasonable amount of retaliate and setting up the bottom when it's necessary.",

And worst-case, if you bring this card and there doesn't end up being a need for the bottom, you're just stuck with the very good top action, so it's a pretty great deal. I will note that it's happened much more often to me that I've tried to get away with not playing this when 'maybe I should but maybe I don't need to' and ended up regretting it than the opposite of having played it and not needing it in the end.</p>"

With a summon triggering an attack, obviously the top action is very, very good. And as has already been mentioned, we do certainly have some uses for Dark (and even more coming).",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, it should be pretty obvious that looting is going to be even more important in Frosthaven than it was in Gloomhaven and you won't naturally walk onto a lot of money as you stand pretty far back from combat, so having the ability to get one of your summons to snatch some loot for you is great.

That being said, it's not quite that simple as we do both need to give up a Skeleton and have the Skeleton in an appropriate location. Giving up a Skeleton can certainly be acceptable if you kill an enemy that would have killed the Skeleton anyway and with a big loss attack like this, that's not unrealistic. As for positioning the Skeleton, you'll most commonly want to combo this top with the bottom of Approach Oblivion. Regardless, the top of this card is not what makes me want to bring it.",
					"bottom": "It's also not necessarily the bottom action either. The bottom action is certainly interesting. Two AoE direct damage is quite good. The downside is that you're not super fast yourself with this (going at 21) so many of your allies will have gone before you. And all of your summons naturally go before you. So the greatest difficulty with this bottom is making sure you trigger it. Obviously you can set this up first then kill an enemy with a top command action - something like Command the Wretched - but 2-3 damage is often not going to be enough. Your melee allies also won't really appreciate triggering this for you. Of course, your summons are mostly melee but at the same time a 3-hp Skeleton and a 1-hp Skeleton are very similar in terms of effectiveness, so it's not the end of the world if they get a bit dinged up exploding some corpses. All-in-all, this is powerful and quite free to play but also harder to use than you would expect, making it fine but not great.",
					"overall": "Exploding Corpse is just fine.<p>We're not unhappy with this card just because of the initiative. At level 1, this is our second-fast initiative, just behind our 18. So while I'm not overly concerned about the value I'm going to get from the top action or bottom action here, just having this around to go at 21 initiative is going to be good enough, whether that's for a Move 2, to set up the bottom in the hopes of getting some free direct damage, or sometimes even to play the top. When you control 2-3 summons in addition to having your own turn, being able to go early in the round can be a huge swing, and definitely justifies making sure we bring some fast initiatives when we can.</p>"

Accordingly, it's not always easy for us to heal ourselves. Even this seemingly-mediocre self-heal is actually really, really welcome. Think about it like this: if you get an average of Heal 1.5 from this each rest cycle and you use it during six rest cycles, that's 4-5 additional Skeletons you'll be able to summon during the scenario. It really does add up. And don't overly focus on the bonus heal here, try to get it if you can, but the most important thing is just making sure you find the chance to play this more than anything, triggering the bonus regularly can be challenging.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the biggest reason you won't use the top action more often on this card is because you'll want to use the bottom even more. Movement that also moves one of your summons is just great. Getting to go early, move a summon, and then use one of your slower top command attacks (especially the more powerful ones without movement tied to them - like Eternal Torment) to have that summon attack something it just approached is a very common and desirable turn.",

If you're desperate, sitting around at 1 or 2 hit points and you can't get anything going because you can't summon, you may be willing to play this with the level 1 summons sometimes. In those cases, it will be acceptable, although not exciting. Where this gets really interested is when you hit level 6 and can use this to negate the six damage, at which point you're looking at a loss Heal 10 self (or sometimes even Heal 14), which is certainly something this class can be in the market for. Unfortunately, by that time, you typically also already have a number of other losses you want to play, so I still only end up running that combo if my other losses don't look good in that scenario or the scenario is quite short.",

There's not much more to say about it than that: with one of your signature summons on top, a spammable and always-welcome Move 4 on bottom, and solid late initiative, this is definitely one of your best level 1 cards. The only catch with this card is that you need to be careful when evaluating your total movement for a scenario: obviously if you summon with the top action, you won't have access to this Move 4, so you need to consider that this won't be a big move ability for you as often as you think when building your hand."

But after the first two turns, I'd pretty much just ignore the top action and just keep this card around for the bottom and its initiative.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is also very good, although more so for one specific build. First of all, this bottom is a net of three hit points and Dark as a bottom heal action, which is honestly amazing. The catch is that you have more difficulty healing yourself than most and if you're trying to summon numerous Skeletons, you have more need of hit points than most. Accordingly, while the effect is very powerful, it's merely an average action in Skeleton-based builds. For single-summon builds, where you don't summon many Skeletons, your hit points are a much less precious resource, and this functions more like a Heal 4 or 5, which is incredible.  It is, unfortunately, only let down by its terrible initiative, especially as you lack fast non-loss top combat actions at low level, meaning the turn you play this for its bottom action will usually be a risky one.",

Obviously it can work out, but all of this to say that Eternal Torment is just generally the better version, and it makes Dark to boot. Still, if you're more interested in having one summon attack often rather than summoning a large army of summons, this has what you need. And in the single-summon build, this top really is quite good: your summon moves for the turn, performs an Attack 3, then you command it to attack with this and it performs an Attack 4. Attack 7 non-loss total for the turn at level 2 (the single-summon build goes from level 2) is pretty excellent.",

Skeletons are disposable so you don't care that much about making sure they don't get into bad spots. Accordingly, they may take some unnecessary punishment, but that's normally not the end of the world to you. Setting up a loss to keep them alive when they may waste some number of charges is not really super appealing, although obviously it can still be very good against bosses. Lastly, the initiative isn't particularly useful for the bottom, but being able to go late when you want your beefy loss summon to run up and hit an enemy is nice, so the initiative can be useful for the top.",

					"bottom": "The bottom doesn't really matter, at least not until later, if you're taking this card for a single-summon build, and I don't think it's enough to take this for a Skeleton-based build. The problem is that the bottom is just kind of awkward for a number of reasons. You can't perfectly control where your summons go, making an AoE like this hard to aim. When the AoE is a top action, you can use a bottom move command to get the summon into position, but the only way to get this into position with a top action is to use something like Command the Wretched, but then you're also attacking before poisoning, which is again awkward. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, you don't have top in-combat actions with good initiative, meaning you'll need to do this late, but obviously it's better to poison enemies early in a round so that your party can take advantage of it. All-in-all, this is a very powerful effect for a level 2 non-loss action, but the power level is significantly balanced out by the awkwardness of using it.",

If your Skeletons are going to take a significant number of hits in the scenario because you don't have allies on the front line absorbing hits for them, this will pretty much always pay for itself to an excellent degree. Now tanking hits with Skeletons feels great - you're getting disarms and retaliate damage from your summons. And again, poison has natural synergy with your Skeletons in the first place, increasing their attacks by 50%. This persistent loss is the basis for an entire build on this class and I think that build is very, very good in many parties.",

If you have access to that, you're already pretty close to getting there with this.</li> <li>A +1 Range enhancement on the bottom of Damned Horde. That enhancement makes it pretty realistic to get two more curses per rest cycle.</li> <li>An ally (or allies) who curse. Obviously if we can't really get there ourself, if we have some help to bridge the gap between ~5 curses and 8-10, we can justify this.</li> <p>If you have any two of the three above, I would seriously consider taking Critical Failure and building around the bottom in a Skeleton Swarm build.</p>"

Getting to go this early in the round and guarantee that one of your summons will survive at least one hit is something every summoner would be happy to have. Obviously it does come with a serious cost - at least for a Skeleton build - but as it's the same cost as just summoning another Skeleton, this is still like getting to summon an in-position Skeleton with a bottom action, which is great.

And shield is common enough (and a significant enough issue for Skeleton builds) that pierce as also welcome damage. This just makes Skeletons a lot better at what they do, which is essentially what you do, all at the cost of going from 12 cards to 11, which is a steal.

The movement is more difficult to evaluate generally and that's just a case-by-case thing. All of this to say: while Solid Bones is amazing to have active, you shouldn't just throw it up every single scenario without thinking about it - there will be some scenarios (or points in a build) where it's not worth playing, even if not many.

You'll definitely want to try to grab some healing items or if your allies can give you a timely Ward before you do this, it would be great. If you don't have access to much healing or Ward in your available items and allies, you should seriously consider using Life in Death's bottom then to help pay for this (activate that bottom the turn you summon this the first time, then try to do just one more summon with it and then this again if you can, although even if you just use it for this and then two normal summons that's also okay).",

The amount of damage enemies deal is really going to be the most important thing to consider. Obviously the upside of having most of our Skeletons get hit twice before dying in many scenarios is worth the fact that we don't use this top action all the time. But just remember that if you're facing enemies that hit for mostly 4+ damage, it's probably not worth playing the top for that scenario specifically in this build (because we care less about the +1 move and the pierce 1).<p>Solid Bones replaces Command the Wretched. As we're using our Skeletons in this build more as meat shields and less as offensive tools (although we still like them to attack on their turns), command attack actions are less important and we need a lot of our top actions for playing Solid Bones, Angry Spirits, and (re-)summoning Skeletons. Accordingly, Command, while still a solid card, makes the most sense to cut. Also, about the number of losses we're playing: I'd generally avoid going above three persistent losses, so pay attention to whether Solid Bones, Angry Spirits, or Decaying Will are played for their loss or not depending on the scenario (their other halves are still fine either way).</p>"

Early on, this only really pairs well with Continuous Health Top, Deadly Shot Top, and Fortitude top if you move the token forwards.

It's important to note here that you can decline to hit enemies in the radius if you have too many where your Loss will fall off before the attacks all resolve.

If you have other melee allies or allies with melee summons, I would certainly switch to this now - you won't regret it.

With an average of two long rests per scenario (which is a bit high of an estimate even given that there are many high tempo scenarios in Frosthaven where you may have one or zero long rests), these will deal the same amount of damage. But the Parrying Gauntlet has the added upside of being able to kill off an enemy reactive to prevent an attack, as well as just being better in short scenarios.

Even then, you need to carefully select your cards, since many 'Slow' effects are actually net positive or neutral if you ignore the bonuses and penalties.

However, PLEASE work with your group to make sure this is actually net upside.Choose your spot wisely.<br><i>Note:</i> If you can't effectively use the big move, this card is still great as an 'initiative 02 Move 2', which allows you to safely take higher risk play lines. For example, it allows you to self-poison or create an element and be guaranteed to be the first to move next round to take advantage of your setup or get to safety.<p><b>Slow: </b>This is more or less a basic move or basic at initiative 32 except in exceptionally rare circumstances. If your allies will heavily benefit from the effect and are all able to safely go after initiative 32, it can be a fun boost… but it's rare to have a spot and even then takes party synergy for the printed text on the 'Slow' bot action to be better than a basic action.

					"overall": "This top action is narrow and generally shouldn't be used except with very specific party compositions and against specific types of enemies (i.e. two high hp elite enemies with low movement in a party that fights from range). The playable core of this card is two things: an incredibly quick 02 initiative Move 6+ (in many parties) or even basic action and a 'Slow' basic action that's quick enough to still go before most enemies. It will be a core card because of how important it is to Blinkblade to initiative weave with complete confidence in high-risk situations. Having your card be an 02 instead of a 12 or a 10 can matter enormously when it matters. (GH players can imagine a Hound, Shaman or Night Demon grouping and the ways those encounters can go wrong if you get beaten on initiative and how nice it is be guarantee you can't be beat)<p>Despite the bonuses this card gets at 3p and 4p, for the initiative on it alone it is still a core recommendation at all levels. In lower party counts if you're confident the enemies are not quick enough for the difference between 02 and 10 or 12 to matter much, it's fine to leave it on the sidelines, but in higher party counts you'll typically want to bring it for quite a long time, and even sometimes bring it back to your hand at higher levels in scenarios where having a big movement can help a lot. Keep it in mind at the start of every scenario, and plan accordingly. Just remember that you need at least half (ideally more) of your cards to have a good non-loss Attack or you'll have trouble, so don't swap this card in for a good Attack in levels where you don't have many.</p>"

Before the immunity perk, one of the best usages of the card is when you've burned through your good 'Fast' actions and need to run two 'Slow' turns in a row.

The Move+Loot helps clean up unlooted coins during traversal, or can validate your greed-driven bad-idea mid-combat looting (“I had to move into range! It's just a coincidence!'). The bottom is a powerful ranged Attack (for a bottom action) but it takes some planning and is often harder than expected to find a good spot for because it doesn't play well with your level 1 Attack+Move top actions' initiatives. It would work alongside a top-moving Hit and Run / Kinetic Transfer type card (which also have poor initiative)… But at 44, this should be played with a quicker card or if our allies can tank for us. Safer level 1 combos are with Experimental Adjustment (to go Invisible early), Blurry Jab (to put out so much damage it kills the enemies so you can safely stand in one place), or Twin Strike (when you Poison with the first attack and/or move away).",

Loot 1 no other text is actually a fairly efficient 'Slow' turn top action if looting is warranted, and it's good for initiative weaving at 74. The bottom action is also a good way to get extra value in a 'Slow' turn where you're near enemies. That said,  It's dangerous if you don't have someone else to tank for you, and taking chances like going at 74 while adjacent to an enemy without an ally to take the hit is a recipe for disaster should your luck turn poor.",
					"overall": "The card's initiative and spacing requirements make the attack difficult to execute safely at level 1 unless your party supports you. As a result, the loot on this can be an actively good card during traversal. Don't feel compelled to run the bottom attack unless you can do so relatively safely. This isn't a Core Card at level 1 for this reason (but is a high tier Supplementary option). Higher levels breathe new life into the card by giving you more good cards to pair it with, like Double Time at 3 (similar to Twin Strike, but Moves after both Attacks) or Reckless Augmentation - where, like with Blurry Jab, you're dealing so much damage at such an early initiative that you often don't need to move. The really important thing about this card's bot-attack is: Pick Your Spot. Playing a careful Blinkblade that doesn't take extra hits and keeps themselves tactically positioned is often better for maximizing damage output than brawling at point blank range by running top attack + bottom attack. At melee range, the bottom attack 'Slow' is almost as good as the top attack (better, even, once you have rolling modifiers), so it's one of the best 'Slow' options when you have someone tanking for you (esp for SlowBlade). Don't stand idly near multiple dangerous enemies taking 74 initiative turns without someone else taking the hits for you and hope it all works out. Have a plan to avoid unnecessary damage. "

Choosing the most effective place to use this card in each rest cycle is going to be an ongoing struggle for your entire Blinkblade career.:<ul><li><i>Mid-high hp un-Shielded enemies</i>: Be sure to use the top attack, especially alongside Poison. The move is often not what you need, but sometimes can let you get where you need to go or traverse rooms quicker if it's still in your hand… but other cards do the traversal job better if available. At low levels, if you don't have a better 'Slow' Attack, the 'Slow' side of this can actually be a fine way to fill out our rest cycle and keep our momentum going until we have better 'Slow' Attacks at higher levels. (just be sure to Poison the thing first)</li><li><i>Shielded enemies, esp w/ allies who like Wind</i>: try to make this your 'Fast' turn Move to set up a big Attack by ignoring Shields at an important time. With Blurry Jab against a Shield 2 enemy, this combo lets you basically Attack 7 + upside non-loss at level 1. Use it in the right spot, profit.</li><li><i>High-damage enemies / low healing group / no frontline</i>: you need to manage your hit points very carefully in some groups. If you're taking too much damage, this is an outstanding Heal for a 'Slow' turn to help you recover and be able to brawl. Especially if your allies care about Earth. Despite how good this is for 'Fast' turns, if you're getting beat up and your allies can't save you, you really need this Heal and you should focus on finding a place to play it on a 'Slow' turn..</li><li>SlowBlade: the top loses its 'Slow' downside alongside Precision Timing, and can even be actively great if you combo it with System Reboot to make it Attack 7 net. SlowBlades actually want the top of this card on 'Slow' turns more than its other modes, unless they need the Heal.</li><li>With Flashing Flurry: this is one of the primary setup cards once you get Flashing Flurry, so builds that take that card will want to be careful to utilize it to ensure they have elements ready to use - especially if they don't have allies who can make elements for them when needed.</li></ul>"

									"comment": "Hit and Run is another powerful, but narrow 'Fast' Attack with a poor initiative, though its 'Slow' action is also decent if our party can benefit. If your party can easily avoid an Immobilized target's attacks, this will usually outperform Sap Speed.

Keep it in mind even for later levels where initiative, Movement, or Wound are going to be very relevant in a scenario."

									"id": "overdrive",
									"comment": "Overdrive is very narrow. You should not use this to try to tank unless you're doing it for fun or memes. The only uses of this card that I don't consider 'just for fun' / suboptimal is a.) In scenarios filled with high Retaliate enemies with low or no Shield value, where its use is obvious, or b.) In scenarios or parties where you NEED the jump to get around smoothly. Both uses are rare, but may still come up at higher levels. If you see the right time, don't hesitate to take the card. When it's good/valuable in a scenario, it's quite important to bring."

This means that pairing 'Fast' Power Leak and Systems Reboot while adjacent to enemies will allow us to make the double Attack 4 while immediately removing the Poison.

Early on, this only really pairs well with Continuous Health Top, Deadly Shot Top, and Fortitude top if you move the token forwards. It's also something you actively don't want to use with an ability like Draining Arrows, as adding Attack 1 Muddle is not worth a full charge.",

I think using this top action is going to be very medium unless you run it with Precision Aim, which will eat up 2 charges each time, but provided you manage your tokens well an Attack 3 Range 4 Target 2 is good value.",
					"bottom": "The bottom of this card is where things get spicy. This is definitely a fantastic option to have available to you, especially when things go awry in the middle-late part of a scenario. The reality is that using this loss may 'save' you your two key losses from falling off mid scenario, and I imagine a Drifter that loses all of their Persistent effect is definitely going to be a bit of a lame duck as far as combat prowess is concerned. If that does happen, your options are to try and turn on another one of your Persistent actions (if they are around) and try and swap builds mid-scenario, which sounds really dicey.",
					"overall": "Another fairly mediocre card for any build and for the bruiser a washout.<p>The initiative of 26 is a decent improvement on 32 as it is getting towards that mark where you beat several monsters, but nothing to take a card for.</p>"

Precision Aim bumps this up to a Range 4 Attack 4, which should all but ensure you get the free token assuming you pick the right target (and don't draw a Null). This is a fantastic staple action that is a good payoff for being a Ranged Drifter, which is an archetype that will definitely burn through tokens, especially if you use both Aim and Barrage from Level 3.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also amazing, being a Move 4 with upside, which from the starters in Frosthaven, seems like it will be a rarity until very high levels (minus Blinkblade). It does not seem difficult to kill something and move forwards afterwards to get your token back and probably grab the loot that dropped.",
					"overall": "The top has no place in a melee build, but we can certainly use the bottom move and  conditional token.<p>This is direct upgrade to Deadly Shot, albeit with a worse initiative, which at 40 is definitely not great, but at least it's not in the 60-70 range again.</p>"

Attack 4 Heal 2 is just going to be a good action for Melee Drifters, either topping up their own health or potentially helping out someone nearby with a nasty condition.  The token regain is unconditional as well so a solid action for us.",
					"bottom": "Although, if you are the frontliner, you will probably take this card for the bottom ability instead.... Sorry, Unbreakable, you had your time in the sun, but it's about time you left. Doubling your sources of shield on a card while having a better top action means that aside from the most dedicated of Tank Drifters, this card becomes an easy replacement for Unbreakable. I don't know if I can even recommend running both Shield Losses at once when there are so many fun and powerful Losses to play on this class, as having 2 shields instead of 3 but actually contributing to the fight is going to be more effective anyways.",
					"overall": "There are two great actions for a melee build and I would be nice to have them both, but ultimately the bottom is going to win out.<p>Initiative 62 sucks, but if you are using this card for its bottom, you are only seeing the number once or twice at least.</p>"

Ward is also a mechanic that scales with the level and difficulty you are playing at nicely, being somewhere in the range of 2-5 damage mitigation unless you are playing at something like +2 difficulty and a big enemy crits. This action is a lot of incremental value, and if it keeps your party alive so they aren't burning cards to damage, then it's a strong option.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is super flavourful for a Drifter (as they are wandering nomads who salvage and re-appropriate for a living), but isn't a particularly exciting action by level 5. It's definitely a good value action with the right kind of Losses in play, and is never going to be bad per se, but I don't think many players will take Survivalist purely for this effect.",
					"overall": "For a bruiser build the top looks great, but we ultimately want to be killing things to prevent damage.<p>I love the bottom of this card as it does so many things we like, but ultimately the question is how much does it add to our deck.</p><p>The 91 initiative is actually very good as it should ensure we go after enemies to hoover up any loot after our allies have killed them for us.</p>"

An attack 4/6 Pierce 2 with the option to add a Wound can end up being something like an effective Attack 9 (if you count the wound as an extra damage, it will often be better than that). That's pretty absurd for a non-burn that is easily repeatable, and makes this level up kind of a nonchoice if you are Melee.",
					"bottom": "This is before even writing about the bottom, too. Again, Move 4's with upside. This one's a little harder to trigger in my opinion than the bottom of Prey that we saw earlier, unless you are moving into the thick of battle. Regardless, it's extra text on top of an already solid action, so you'll take it. ",
					"overall": "I don't think there is a world where you don't take Break Through with this build, no matter how much fun that Loot Heal action from Survivalist looks. <p>Initiative 34 is fine, although Drifter's will definitely have problems depending on card choice where the lion's share of your actions fall into the 30-70 range.</p>"

					"bottom": "The bottom is reasonable enough, but is definitely a far cry from the Strengthen actions we've seen in the past. However, this is again something that both Melee and Ranged Drifters focused on damage probably want in their arsenal, as so far Drifter has had no access to Strengthen-style effects (Enhancement pips notwithstanding).",
					"overall": "This is isn't great for the melee build as we already have pierce on our attacks.<p>The Initiative on this card does it no favours, unfortunately, meaning if you plan to use this action for its bottom primarily, you will need to pair it with another card that either goes fast or slow.

This is a pretty cool action to pair with the bottom of Fierce Barrage, as getting an extra target also means a bigger heal for the target of your Heal action. An attack 2 is definitely weak by this point, so this is pretty specialized for Ranged Drifters and/or Support Drifters who also attack at range.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is a pretty sweet action when the situation lines up well, however moving the tokens back is definitely not always going to happen. The Initiative being 21 means you have a good shot at it though, as the wording means that as long as you've gone before your other allies, and a target adjacent to you dies, you get to move the token back. I feel the Retaliate is definitely extra help towards this goal, but ultimately most people will try and play this is as a move 2 that can potentially move back multiple tokens. Which is still good value when you can make it work consistently, of course.",
					"overall": "Consume Stamina kind of ends up being the polar opposite of Strikes above, where it focused on support and defence instead of damage.<p>The top is nothing that the melee build is interested in but we can certainly use a quick move with retaliate and a potential token management.</p>"

Given that support builds tend to throw heals out there on a regular basis this would mean that they are trying to manage two token tracks when this functionality is probably not required every time.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action is what gets me really excited for this card, and wanting to dredge up our friend from Level 1, the bottom of Sustained Momentum. Anything that turns this Move 3 into a Move 5, (even something like Boots of Striding) is going to be invaluable, as getting multiple tokens moved back on a staple move action is going to feel really good. This is the kind of ability that often makes a class 'tick' at higher levels, when you can start going nuts and using your cool stuff in a far less measured, conservative manner. Note that this says ally, which does include what will be more common NPC allies and Summons.",

It's an easier to set up Fierce Barrage Top that can target the same enemy twice, and also gives you a move action in between if you end up killing your primary target.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action here is pretty filler for a Level 7 Loss, as you do need to have 3 different persistent abilities active all with at least 3 Use Slots filled in. I don't find this to be an overwhelming upgrade from Dual Bow's bottom at level 3, so I think this is again the kind of action that is nice to have, but if you took Dual Bow at Level 3 this becomes far less attractive.",

This is the kind of action that looks super gimmicky, but is obviously ridiculous for Melee Drifters, provided they hit 5 or less targets (as you move the tokens back AFTER the attacks resolve, assuming you still have Crushing Weight in play), they can essentially chain this as a massive Attack 3 AoE whenever they want it. It's important to note here that you can decline to hit enemies in the radius if you have too many where your Loss will fall off before the attacks all resolve. It's even pretty reasonable on other builds who are okay wading in close to enemies, simply to flip modifiers and move back a bunch of tokens.",

This is definitely a build-dependant Loss, as you need to be able to move your Use Tokens back quickly after this kind of effect, but something like an Attack 5 Range 3 (with Precision Aim) Immobilize 4-5 targets is obviously great. What will ultimately determine this cards usability is how generally useful the bottom action is.",

It's also awkward that it doesn't save you from the actions you are most likely to have to lose a card to, especially unexpected 2x's drawn by a monster or an untimely Brittle.",
					"bottom": "Adding an extra target to a Heal 3 Range 3 Regenerate Strengthen is pretty incredible value, and any action that can Self Strengthen repeatedly (especially when tied to other effects) is going to have my attention. This isn't the strongest action for a level 9 in the world, but it's likely going to be a workhorse.",

					"bottom": "The bottom action definitely has a combo-sort of feel to it, as just like Just the Wind before it, this is the kind of action where you want to dump everything into moving absurdly quickly and then bashing something for like 7+ damage as a <em>bottom</em> action. It's not even difficult to envision this being more than an Attack 7, as you get to 'double dip' on the Move and Attack values both being modified by many of Drifters persistent abilities.",

Precision Aim bumps this up to a Range 4 Attack 4, which should all but ensure you get the free token assuming you pick the right target (and don't draw a Null). This is a fantastic staple action that is a good payoff for being a Ranged Drifter, which is an archetype that will definitely burn through tokens, especially if you use both Aim and Barrage from Level 3.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also amazing, being a Move 4 with upside, which from the starters in Frosthaven, seems like it will be a rarity until very high levels (minus Blinkblade). It does not seem difficult to kill something and move forwards afterwards to get your token back and probably grab the loot that dropped.",
					"overall": "The top has no place in a melee build, but we can certainly use the bottom move and  conditional token.<p>This is direct upgrade to Deadly Shot, albeit with a worse initiative, which at 40 is definitely not great, but at least it's not in the 60-70 range again.</p>"

Attack 4 Heal 2 is just going to be a good action for Melee Drifters, either topping up their own health or potentially helping out someone nearby with a nasty condition.  The token regain is unconditional as well so a solid action for us.",
					"bottom": "Although, if you are the frontliner, you will probably take this card for the bottom ability instead.... Sorry, Unbreakable, you had your time in the sun, but it's about time you left. Doubling your sources of shield on a card while having a better top action means that aside from the most dedicated of Tank Drifters, this card becomes an easy replacement for Unbreakable. I don't know if I can even recommend running both Shield Losses at once when there are so many fun and powerful Losses to play on this class, as having 2 shields instead of 3 but actually contributing to the fight is going to be more effective anyways.",
					"overall": "There are two great actions for a melee build and I would be nice to have them both, but ultimately the bottom is going to win out.<p>Initiative 62 sucks, but if you are using this card for its bottom, you are only seeing the number once or twice at least.</p>"

Ward is also a mechanic that scales with the level and difficulty you are playing at nicely, being somewhere in the range of 2-5 damage mitigation unless you are playing at something like +2 difficulty and a big enemy crits. This action is a lot of incremental value, and if it keeps your party alive so they aren't burning cards to damage, then it's a strong option.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is super flavourful for a Drifter (as they are wandering nomads who salvage and re-appropriate for a living), but isn't a particularly exciting action by level 5. It's definitely a good value action with the right kind of Losses in play, and is never going to be bad per se, but I don't think many players will take Survivalist purely for this effect.",

An attack 4/6 Pierce 2 with the option to add a Wound can end up being something like an effective Attack 9 (if you count the wound as an extra damage, it will often be better than that). That's pretty absurd for a non-burn that is easily repeatable, and makes this level up kind of a nonchoice if you are Melee.",
					"bottom": "This is before even writing about the bottom, too. Again, Move 4's with upside. This one's a little harder to trigger in my opinion than the bottom of Prey that we saw earlier, unless you are moving into the thick of battle.

					"overall": "I don't think there is a world where you don't take Break Through with this build, no matter how much fun that Loot Heal action from Survivalist looks. <p>Initiative 34 is fine, although Drifter's will definitely have problems depending on card choice where the lion's share of your actions fall into the 30-70 range.</p>"

An attack 2 is definitely weak by this point, so this is pretty specialized for Ranged Drifters and/or Support Drifters who also attack at range.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is a pretty sweet action when the situation lines up well, however moving the tokens back is definitely not always going to happen. The Initiative being 21 means you have a good shot at it though, as the wording means that as long as you've gone before your other allies, and a target adjacent to you dies, you get to move the token back. I feel the Retaliate is definitely extra help towards this goal, but ultimately most people will try and play this is as a move 2 that can potentially move back multiple tokens. Which is still good value when you can make it work consistently, of course.",
					"overall": "Consume Stamina kind of ends up being the polar opposite of Strikes above, where it focused on support and defence instead of damage.<p>The top is nothing that the melee build is interested in but we can certainly use a quick move with retaliate and a potential token management.</p>"

Anything that turns this Move 3 into a Move 5, (even something like Boots of Striding) is going to be invaluable, as getting multiple tokens moved back on a staple move action is going to feel really good. This is the kind of ability that often makes a class 'tick' at higher levels, when you can start going nuts and using your cool stuff in a far less measured, conservative manner. Note that this says ally, which does include what will be more common NPC allies and Summons.",

It's an easier to set up Fierce Barrage Top that can target the same enemy twice, and also gives you a move action in between if you end up killing your primary target.",

It's important to note here that you can decline to hit enemies in the radius if you have too many where your Loss will fall off before the attacks all resolve. It's even pretty reasonable on other builds who are okay wading in close to enemies, simply to flip modifiers and move back a bunch of tokens.",

This isn't the strongest action for a level 9 in the world, but it's likely going to be a workhorse.",

Ignore all 'Slow' penalties and bonuses.' A typical good use case for this loss is “for your next three 'Slow' turns, add +1 attack to one attack, +1 move to one move and immobilize 1-2 enemies'. Even then, you need to carefully select your cards, since many 'Slow' effects are actually net positive or neutral if you ignore the bonuses and penalties. In other words, the majority of the value you get is tied to the Immobilize. If the party and enemy composition allows you to benefit from 4+ Immobilizes across 3 turns by preventing enemies from doing anything 4-6 times, it's reasonably strong. Less than that and it's starting to be a questionable choice vs your other loss options.

However, PLEASE work with your group to make sure this is actually net upside.Choose your spot wisely.<br><i>Note:</i> If you can't effectively use the big move, this card is still great as an 'initiative 02 Move 2', which allows you to safely take higher risk play lines. For example, it allows you to self-poison or create an element and be guaranteed to be the first to move next round to take advantage of your setup or get to safety.<p><b>Slow: </b>This is more or less a basic move or basic at initiative 32 except in exceptionally rare circumstances. If your allies will heavily benefit from the effect and are all able to safely go after initiative 32, it can be a fun boost… but it's rare to have a spot and even then takes party synergy for the printed text on the 'Slow' bot action to be better than a basic action. With that said, this is also the quickest 'Slow' action in our kit for a long time so 'initiative 32 basic action' can be an important option to have for 'Slow' turns!</p>",
					"overall": "This top action is narrow and generally shouldn't be used except with very specific party compositions and against specific types of enemies (i.e. two high hp elite enemies with low movement in a party that fights from range). The playable core of this card is two things: an incredibly quick 02 initiative Move 6+ (in many parties) or even basic action and a 'Slow' basic action that's quick enough to still go before most enemies. It will be a core card because of how important it is to Blinkblade to initiative weave with complete confidence in high-risk situations. Having your card be an 02 instead of a 12 or a 10 can matter enormously when it matters. (GH players can imagine a Hound, Shaman or Night Demon grouping and the ways those encounters can go wrong if you get beaten on initiative and how nice it is be guarantee you can't be beat)<p>Despite the bonuses this card gets at 3p and 4p, for the initiative on it alone it is still a core recommendation at all levels. In lower party counts if you're confident the enemies are not quick enough for the difference between 02 and 10 or 12 to matter much, it's fine to leave it on the sidelines, but in higher party counts you'll typically want to bring it for quite a long time, and even sometimes bring it back to your hand at higher levels in scenarios where having a big movement can help a lot. Keep it in mind at the start of every scenario, and plan accordingly. Just remember that you need at least half (ideally more) of your cards to have a good non-loss Attack or you'll have trouble, so don't swap this card in for a good Attack in levels where you don't have many.</p>"

Before the immunity perk, one of the best usages of the card is when you've burned through your good 'Fast' actions and need to run two 'Slow' turns in a row.

Just the baseline 'Wound + 2 guaranteed damage' version is actually quite good! The bottom action is interesting, and it can give us a lot of healing - but only if our party helps us line it up. It's a bit clunky at 52 initiative. The Time Token consumption here is not worth it, so don't do it unless you've got a huge pile of Time Tokens.",
					"bottom": "<b>Slow: </b>The top of this card needs you or your party to be doing the wound thing. It's a great card if there's 2+ wounded enemies: it's damage that ignores Range, Retaliate, Shields and line-of-sight. The initiative is ideal for initiative weaving at 82 and against a wounded target, you can pile damage into them from a safe distance. The bottom of the card wants your party to walk to you to receive a Heal. If the party needs the Heal and doesn't mind coming to you, it's strong. However, it can be awkward to set up except in melee-heavy parties.",
					"overall": "This is the kind of card that shines in some scenarios and party compositions and is not as good in other party compositions or scenarios. It is, however, often better than it looks and only needs one previous wound to pull its top action's weight. We keep it a while because it gives a Heal and a good option against enemies we struggle with."

The Attack 3 advantage is obviously great if it hits 2 enemies, and you should try hard to line that up, since it's just ok if it hits one. Because of its awkwardly late 45 'Fast' initiative, it wants to be paired  with quicker move-heavy cards - start a turn adjacent to two enemies, deliver a strong hit, and get out of the way.

The Move+Loot helps clean up unlooted coins during traversal, or can validate your greed-driven bad-idea mid-combat looting (“I had to move into range! It's just a coincidence!'). The bottom is a powerful ranged Attack (for a bottom action) but it takes some planning and is often harder than expected to find a good spot for because it doesn't play well with your level 1 Attack+Move top actions' initiatives. It would work alongside a top-moving Hit and Run / Kinetic Transfer type card (which also have poor initiative)… But at 44, this should be played with a quicker card or if our allies can tank for us.

Loot 1 no other text is actually a fairly efficient 'Slow' turn top action if looting is warranted, and it's good for initiative weaving at 74. The bottom action is also a good way to get extra value in a 'Slow' turn where you're near enemies.

As a result, the loot on this can be an actively good card during traversal. Don't feel compelled to run the bottom attack unless you can do so relatively safely. This isn't a Core Card at level 1 for this reason (but is a high tier Supplementary option). Higher levels breathe new life into the card by giving you more good cards to pair it with, like Double Time at 3 (similar to Twin Strike, but Moves after both Attacks) or Reckless Augmentation - where, like with Blurry Jab, you're dealing so much damage at such an early initiative that you often don't need to move. The really important thing about this card's bot-attack is: Pick Your Spot. Playing a careful Blinkblade that doesn't take extra hits and keeps themselves tactically positioned is often better for maximizing damage output than brawling at point blank range by running top attack + bottom attack. At melee range, the bottom attack 'Slow' is almost as good as the top attack (better, even, once you have rolling modifiers), so it's one of the best 'Slow' options when you have someone tanking for you (esp for SlowBlade). Don't stand idly near multiple dangerous enemies taking 74 initiative turns without someone else taking the hits for you and hope it all works out. Have a plan to avoid unnecessary damage. "

Choosing the most effective place to use this card in each rest cycle is going to be an ongoing struggle for your entire Blinkblade career.:<ul><li><i>Mid-high hp un-Shielded enemies</i>: Be sure to use the top attack, especially alongside Poison. The move is often not what you need, but sometimes can let you get where you need to go or traverse rooms quicker if it's still in your hand… but other cards do the traversal job better if available. At low levels, if you don't have a better 'Slow' Attack, the 'Slow' side of this can actually be a fine way to fill out our rest cycle and keep our momentum going until we have better 'Slow' Attacks at higher levels. (just be sure to Poison the thing first)</li><li><i>Shielded enemies, esp w/ allies who like Wind</i>: try to make this your 'Fast' turn Move to set up a big Attack by ignoring Shields at an important time. With Blurry Jab against a Shield 2 enemy, this combo lets you basically Attack 7 + upside non-loss at level 1. Use it in the right spot, profit.</li><li><i>High-damage enemies / low healing group / no frontline</i>: you need to manage your hit points very carefully in some groups. If you're taking too much damage, this is an outstanding Heal for a 'Slow' turn to help you recover and be able to brawl. Especially if your allies care about Earth. Despite how good this is for 'Fast' turns, if you're getting beat up and your allies can't save you, you really need this Heal and you should focus on finding a place to play it on a 'Slow' turn..</li><li>SlowBlade: the top loses its 'Slow' downside alongside Precision Timing, and can even be actively great if you combo it with System Reboot to make it Attack 7 net. SlowBlades actually want the top of this card on 'Slow' turns more than its other modes, unless they need the Heal.</li><li>With Flashing Flurry: this is one of the primary setup cards once you get Flashing Flurry, so builds that take that card will want to be careful to utilize it to ensure they have elements ready to use - especially if they don't have allies who can make elements for them when needed.</li></ul>"

Some mind-blowingly amazing target damage come from using this ability with Breakneck Speed and Double Time active. It's level 9, so if you're a NovaBlade - just have fun with it!

It's also a great combo with Sand in the Hourglass.<br>The Move 5 is the weaker half of the card, but is still valuable if you need to quickly traverse. The top being so strong means you should try to use other cards to traverse if possible.",

The 'Slow' Attack is  weak and shouldn't be used, but the 'Move 2 + 1 damage' has some tactical uses against certain types of enemies. That said, the 'Fast' side of this card is very good, so unless the 1 damage will get you a kill or is hitting an enemy with Shield and/or Retaliate, you should avoid trying to use this during 'Slow' turns and prioritize your hand so you don't have to. Against an enemy with both high Shield and Retaliate, though, this 'Slow' move is the best part of the card.",

Ignore all 'Slow' penalties and bonuses.' A typical good use case for this loss is 'for your next three 'Slow' turns, add +1 attack to one attack, +1 move to one move and immobilize 1-2 enemies'. Even then, you need to carefully select your cards, since many 'Slow' effects are actually net positive or neutral if you ignore the bonuses and penalties. In other words, the majority of the value you get is tied to the Immobilize. If the party and enemy composition allows you to benefit from 4+ Immobilizes across 3 turns by preventing enemies from doing anything 4-6 times, it's reasonably strong. Less than that and it's starting to be a questionable choice vs your other loss options. It's a ton of work, for example, to get a Cascading Reaction's loss (Attack 3 Wound, Move 3, Attack 3 Wound) worth of value from this.",
					"bottom": "<b>Fast: </b>In a large party, this is an absolutely absurd card, granting 6+ movement (often higher if anyone has summons or the scenario gives you an ally). Its initiative is perfect for weaving or going earlier than the quickest enemies, and it can give you options no other card can. However, PLEASE work with your group to make sure this is actually net upside.Choose your spot wisely.<br><i>Note:</i> If you can't effectively use the big move, this card is still great as an 'initiative 02 Move 2', which allows you to safely take higher risk play lines. For example, it allows you to self-poison or create an element and be guaranteed to be the first to move next round to take advantage of your setup or get to safety.<p><b>Slow: </b>This is more or less a basic move or basic at initiative 32 except in exceptionally rare circumstances. If your allies will heavily benefit from the effect and are all able to safely go after initiative 32, it can be a fun boost… but it's rare to have a spot and even then takes party synergy for the printed text on the 'Slow' bot action to be better than a basic action. With that said, this is also the quickest 'Slow' action in our kit for a long time so 'initiative 32 basic action' can be an important option to have for 'Slow' turns!</p>",
					"overall": "This top action is narrow and generally shouldn't be used except with very specific party compositions and against specific types of enemies (i.e. two high hp elite enemies with low movement in a party that fights from range). The playable core of this card is two things: an incredibly quick 02 initiative Move 6+ (in many parties) or even basic action and a 'Slow' basic action that's quick enough to still go before most enemies. It will be a core card because of how important it is to Blinkblade to initiative weave with complete confidence in high-risk situations. Having your card be an 02 instead of a 12 or a 10 can matter enormously when it matters. (GH players can imagine a Hound, Shaman or Night Demon grouping and the ways those encounters can go wrong if you get beaten on initiative and how nice it is be guarantee you can't be beat)<p>Despite the bonuses this card gets at 3p and 4p, for the initiative on it alone it is still a core recommendation at all levels. In lower party counts if you're confident the enemies are not quick enough for the difference between 02 and 10 or 12 to matter much, it's fine to leave it on the sidelines, but in higher party counts you'll typically want to bring it for quite a long time, and even sometimes bring it back to your hand at higher levels in scenarios where having a big movement can help a lot. Keep it in mind at the start of every scenario, and plan accordingly. Just remember that you need at least half (ideally more) of your cards to have a good non-loss Attack or you'll have trouble, so don't swap this card in for a good Attack in levels where you don't have many.</p>"

In a very Wound heavy/synergistic party, the top becomes more playable, but it's generally something you'd want to avoid running as a loss prior to the last room.

Try to avoid using it 'Fast' without a good reason. Use the top for the last/most challenging room if it'll give you a good tempo burst.

Every part of this card's 'Fast' action top is good - just be sure to keep enough hit points to use it. The hit point cost for this card is one of the reasons it's important to avoid unnecessary damage - it's an amazing 'get out of jail free' card, but only if you stay at 3 or more hp. The move-loot is fine if you need it, but it's one of the most comparatively weak options on the card and you should not prioritize it unless you've got reason to.

You can pick up the 'Immobilize immunity' perk to maximize this card, but it's outstanding even if you don't do so (though you need to be a bit more careful and not immobilize yourself near enemies that will survive to hit you). Before the immunity perk, one of the best usages of the card is when you've burned through your good 'Fast' actions and need to run two 'Slow' turns in a row. This 'Slow' move can get you out of harm's way and set you up to long rest or Drive Recharge Heal+Regen next turn where the Immobilize has no downside. ",
					"overall": "This card has two modes that are some of your most powerful options with (relatively) good initiative: Top Invisibility + enemy damage aoe when 'Fast', and bottom Move 4 when 'Slow'. Both of these are outstandingly strong and you should pick one of the two and use it every rest cycle that you're in a good spot for it. This is an X card, but it's holding two very good actions and often will stay in your hand for a long time. A good rule with this card is: if there's a lot of enemies, use the 'Fast' Invisibility option to set yourself up for a good 'Slow' turn while distributing a pile of damage. If there's only a few enemies with later average initiatives or the scenario has a long distance to traverse, lean into utilizing the Move 4 to help maximize your distance traveled during 'Slow' turns and set yourself up for long rests."

If you have people to take hits for you while you go 'Slow' adjacent to enemies, this has a great 'Fast' combo with Temporal Displacement bot, but the initiatives combine poorly.<p><b>Slow: </b>Good for initiative weaving and a solid 'Slow' attack if the CC is valuable.

It is a great card for much of our Blinkblade career. The initiative is poor, so you need to work around that.

Higher levels breathe new life into the card by giving you more good cards to pair it with, like Double Time at 3 (similar to Twin Strike, but Moves after both Attacks) or Reckless Augmentation - where, like with Blurry Jab, you're dealing so much damage at such an early initiative that you often don't need to move. The really important thing about this card's bot-attack is: Pick Your Spot. Playing a careful Blinkblade that doesn't take extra hits and keeps themselves tactically positioned is often better for maximizing damage output than brawling at point blank range by running top attack + bottom attack. At melee range, the bottom attack 'Slow' is almost as good as the top attack (better, even, once you have rolling modifiers), so it's one of the best 'Slow' options when you have someone tanking for you (esp for SlowBlade).

(just be sure to Poison the thing first)</li><li><i>Shielded enemies, esp w/ allies who like Wind</i>: try to make this your 'Fast' turn Move to set up a big Attack by ignoring Shields at an important time. With Blurry Jab against a Shield 2 enemy, this combo lets you basically Attack 7 + upside non-loss at level 1. Use it in the right spot, profit.</li><li><i>High-damage enemies / low healing group / no frontline</i>: you need to manage your hit points very carefully in some groups. If you're taking too much damage, this is an outstanding Heal for a 'Slow' turn to help you recover and be able to brawl. Especially if your allies care about Earth. Despite how good this is for 'Fast' turns, if you're getting beat up and your allies can't save you, you really need this Heal and you should focus on finding a place to play it on a 'Slow' turn..</li><li>With Flashing Flurry: this is one of the primary setup cards once you get Flashing Flurry, so builds that take that card will want to be careful to utilize it to ensure they have elements ready to use - especially if they don't have allies who can make elements for them when needed.</li></ul>"

The bottom is better on a 'Fast' move where we get to Move and attack with <i>Wound</i>. It replaces Drive Rechange due to the additional recovery and sustain options we now have available. Adding an additional non-loss Wound will incidentally improve Sand in the Hourglass' performance. If your party is not able to support you and you feel like you need more sustain and Healing, it may make sense to keep Drive Recharge and instead remove Temporal Displacement, which often performs best when we can be more free to stay adjacent to enemies."

As with Chain Hood, any form of Shield stacking alongside your persistent loss is very, very powerful. And Sturdy Greaves are much easier to use as well.

This will pretty much represent the same amount of effective hit points gained as the Major Healing Potion, only spread across three figures (which is generally a bit of a downside) but with added safety (assurance against a damage spike leading to a pitched card - which is obvious upside)."
