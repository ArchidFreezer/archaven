		<p>The Puppetmaster build focuses on the Deathwalker's ability to attack from afar, and consume shadows in bulk for additional, powerful effects. This build has a higher emphasis on dark consumption, lower focus on keeping our shadow count high, and puts us in much less physical danger.</p>
		<p>So why would you play a Puppetmaster Build?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't enjoy getting in close with your low health pool. This build will take far fewer hits overall than the other build, so you aren't risking losing cards due to your low health pool. If you're doing your job right, you shouldn't really take any hits that you don't want to.</li>
			<li>You like resource management. This build has to determine when and how to spend their shadows, and makes liberal use of dark with their abilities. You'll need to manage both pools of resources in order to maximize your impact.</li>
			<li>You like big, bursty turns. A few times each scenario, you'll be able to spend a huge chunk of shadows for value that would otherwise be lost.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The tank build loves the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A crowded frontline. Your shadows will weave around the enemies, but they don't block movement, so you'll never be in the way. Melee classes and summon classes in high player count parties will like that you can stand very far back.</li>
			<li>Low damage and high crowd control. You deal a ton of damage but don't really have good ways to lock enemies down, so if others can hold them still you'll be able to take them out.</li>
			<li>Additional payoff for curse. This build does a lot of damage, but in smaller, more spaced out instances, so it's more likely that you'll be able to apply curse here. If you have a party that benefits from this, such as a Critical Failure Boneshaper, then this is the way you can help them the most.</li>

							<p>We can consume a number of shadows to increase our attack. Each shadow on its own provides low value, or moderate value if the enemy has shield. If we think of Fluid Night as +3 damage and increased ranged over the standard attack two, then it takes three shadows here to catch up.  If the shadows have alternate uses, or if you know you'll be able to get them to the next room at low cost, I would only use this against shielded enemies. Against those, each shadow gives +2 damage, which is a fairly decent use. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.</p>

							<p>Adds wound to an enemy starting in or moving through a shadow, It's better if they start in the shadow as then it will tick immediately, but that isn't always possible.<p>In a narrow corridor this can be a great action, and can be paired with Eclipse to start a scenario.</p></p>

							<p>This is a staple damage card with two good halves and great initiative.<p>There is one very significant reason we love this card: XP. More often than not, you will be leaving behind at least a few shadows in a room. When progressing to the next room, we can spend tons of actions getting them in half-decent position. Alternatively, we can use this top to blow up an enemy, gain up to five XP, and then be early to the next room and start marking enemies to make shadows immediately.</p><p>At worst this card is a fast move 2.</p></p>

							<p>Black Barrage on top gives our first attack that doesn't care at all about shadows, but does care quite a bit about dark. This attack is very low risk, low reward. An attack 3 at very long range doesn't do a ton of damage, but it marks a key target at good (but not great) initiative and lets you perform the ability from a safe distance.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is a happy medium between Wave of Anguish and Dark Fog in terms of shadow movement. We'll get to move all of our shadows, and we'll get to move them a moderate amount.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Another decent card.<p>The top is a fine attack to open the scenario with at lower levels, letting you mark a target that is likely to die and set up shadows for future rounds.</p><p>Just like the top, the bottom isn't flashy but it's solid and we're rarely upset to use this action.</p></p>

							<p>With a precisely placed shadow, you can hit a lot of things for free. This is similar to the loss from Lingering Rot, but it's much weaker, and muddles (with dark) Instead of poisons. I wouldn't bother emphasizing the dark on this action, as muddle isn't an amazing condition and it doesn't even get you an XP. Still, if lots of enemies are low, then you can use this to potentially pick up several shadows with lucky flips. Furthermore, some of your modifiers have great conditions, so this is a good way to dig for those.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is a core action that's not fancy, but gets the job done. We're about to see a few attacks that need darkness to function, unlike the top of this card, which can do without.</p>

							<p>The top action allows you to mark any enemy attacked by you or one of your summons. When a marked enemy dies, you may create a shadow in the figure's hex or in an adjacent hex. It is important to note that you do not have to be the one to land the killing blow; it is enough to mark an enemy, then have an ally, trap, wound, or other source of damage finish them off. You can only have one enemy marked at once, so when you attack a different enemy, you must choose (before pulling your modifier) whether to move the mark or leave it on the previous target. Remember that when performing multi-target attacks, you can choose the order of targets; whenever practical, you should choose to first attack targets that have a chance of dying, so that you can generate shadows from the kills and leave the last enemy marked. This will be the first or second action you play in nearly every scenario in every level of every build path. Through this action, you can consistently generate somewhere in the range of 3-5 shadows in a longer rest cycle, depending on how much health the enemies have.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action reliably makes exactly one shadow per rest cycle. In some scenarios where the first room is extremely dangerous and your team needs you to act immediately, you can get away with using this on your first turn and doing something with shadows right away. In general, we would like to avoid using this, not because the action is bad, but because of the opportunity cost of not being able to use the top. Not having the top for an entire rest cycle will feel very bad, as you will make one shadow on bottom but lose at least two or three from the top.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Call to the Abyss is a 100% mandatory card for any Deathwalker. This is your only way to repeatedly make shadows at lower levels, and without shadows, your power is greatly diminished.<p>We would love to play both halves, and if you had an item or ally that can recover a card for you, you could open with the bottom of this card on the first round, recover the card, and play the top on turn two or three.</p></p>

							<p>A very straightforward loss. Hit three things in a triangle, curse the ones that live, make our core element, get an XP. This could have been in the Tinkerer's kit and we wouldn't have batted an eye. The only catch is that we're not always sure when we want to get the curses and when we want to get kills for more shadows. If we kill several targets in quick succession, we get multiple shadows; if the targets live, we get multiple curses. The flexibility between curses and shadows make this a highly potent action. Just be careful: it is tempting to use this every time we see a triangle, but between this, Call to the Abyss, and Eclipse, our stamina is precious. Try not to use this the first instant it comes up, or we won't be able to make it to the final room.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Rather than moving all of our shadows a little, we move one shadow a lot. This will certainly get the shadow into proper position for actions like Fluid Night and Shadow Step, and will actually allow us to move at least one of our shadows to the next room, hopefully to teleport to.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>A powerful loss and a useful spammable bottom makes another good card, let down by a poor initiative.<p>For any build that relies on teleporting or frequent and precise shadow positioning, we're going to need this card.</p></p>

							<p>This provides 3 shadows right away and you get some of your element as a nice kicker.<p>Of course, Call to the Abyss will generate more shadows over the course of a scenario. However, there are a few big reasons we might play Eclipse. First, Eclipse makes the shadows instantly. If there aren't low HP enemies that are likely to die in the first two rounds, you are going to be struggling without shadows at the start of the scenario. Eclipse can help you come online a bit faster. Because this isn't on the same card as Call to the Abyss, we can even do both!</p></p>
							<hr>
							<p>he bottom is actually very significant for us, as we don't have a large number of high movement actions. If your plan is to traverse the map by teleporting, then this probably won't make a very large difference. If, however, you need to walk from place to place, or need to traverse a room but not the whole map, then this action is fantastic. As a result, we're more than happy to lug this around in scenarios where we don't need it in the first room, and drop it in the last room. It will cost us a loss, but it will save us many turns of repositioning the shadows from room one into room three, and that's a win.</p>

							<p>An attack 5 at any range that creates Dark, what's not to like.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Spending a shadow to negate a hit is a very reasonable safety net. Ideally you won't be getting hit much when you don't want to, but if you do accidentally take one very large hit, you can use this to save your bacon. Unless you've shoved a shadow forwards in the midst of fighting, the teleport will probably not gain you much tempo in terms of positioning. However, since we can choose to skip this on small sources of damage and save it for big ones, this action is a fantastic use of a bottom action for whenever we have the spare time and don't need the top.</p>

							<p>Our last dark consumption was low risk low reward; here, we get the opposite. We have to get in close to get the damage off here. More often than I can count, I moved in to line up this double hit and lost a card or two for my troubles. If you can avoid the punishment, though, then this is insane value. Non-loss attack six is on par with our strongest actions, and the ability to split it on two targets means we'll very frequently be able to kill the first enemy and either mark or kill the second, for a total gain of two shadows.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is our second non-loss teleport at low levels. The extra benefit here is that we can choose to be adjacent to the shadow. It's not a huge gain, but that might amount to one extra movement point, which often lets us perform a melee attack that we otherwise couldn't. Also, if someone is taking up our desired shadow, we can still make progress.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>I typically try to initiative weave with this one, pairing it with a very fast or slow initiative to ensure that I don't end up being punished for the aggressive positioning that the top action requires.<p>The bottom is only let down by the fact that it prevents us using the top.</p></p>

							<p>The top action is fantastic; this could theoretically be an attack on up to seven enemies if they clump up properly. Attack three and poison is very high value for an action with this many targets, so if we can hit at least 4 or 5 enemies, we're happy to run this loss. Since the enemies do need to clump first, we'll typically try to run this as the second card after opening a room, so that the enemies can walk up a bit first.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Move 3 is fine, and the ability to make poison is fantastic. If our goal is to run melee attacks, we're going to love this card for our entire lifespan. If our goal is to deal our damage from a distance, we won't want to do this, both because it puts us in too much danger and because we need our bottom actions to position shadows for us.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

							<p>Our last action is our most situational. The top lets us heal everyone who is in a shadow. This requires a lot of coordination to heal more than two targets. In scenarios with lots of negative conditions, it might be worth posturing around, but most of the time it's just not efficient. Our shadows will be near the enemies, not near our allies, and moving them properly means we'll need to move them back to attack with in the future. It's a lot of work for a very situational effect, and we're usually better off preventing damage by killing things than by healing it after the fact.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is again situational. Moving all shadows six is absolutely powerful, as it lets us keep our momentum from the first room moving into the third room. However, in some cases we won't have enough shadows to bother, or the walk will be too long to be worth it, or else too short to require this loss.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>There is definitely a support deathwalker build that you can attempt, but it's so dependent on who your allies are that I won't expand fully on it here. For that build, you will love this action. For damage-focused builds, it's underwhelming at best.<p>If the top was spammable, we'd be fine to bring this around, but unfortunately this card just doesn't make the cut.</p></p>

							<p>Top movement is fantastic, especially when it comes with an attached attack. Unfortunately for us, we don't actually have any bottom attacks early, so this isn't really an extra attack so much as it is our only attack. Still, we can either combine this with a move to rapidly traverse the map towards an enemy, or combine it with some shadow movement to properly line up the hit. This isn't our strongest attack, but the movement is good enough that we're happy to have it.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom loss can be ok. An emergency shadow drop in your own space can help smooth down an awkward situation if you weren't able to get your marked target to die and really need a shadow to get anything done. The large movement and fast initiative will get you wherever you need to be before your targets move, so in a pinch this can work great. Most of the time, we won't plan to use this, but it will save our bacon in numerous occasions.</p>

							<p>The top of this card justifies a world where we don't aim to consume shadows, but instead prefer to leave them on the map. If we have all of our shadows out, this will be an attack six as a non-loss action. That's incredibly strong. It'll definitely take a few turns to get there, especially if we don't run the loss on eclipse, but once we've got them, it'll be pretty easy for us to keep them up. Unless we're running something like Anger of the Dead that consumes multiple shadows at once, we typically expect our shadow gain to be net positive, so it's still going to be worth it to spend a shadow here or there for some extra value, but the bar for that value is that much higher now that the shadow will also cost us one damage on this attack if we don't replace it.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is decent. We saw with our shadow consumption that adding +2 is fairly average in terms of what we can expect from consuming a shadow. Getting the ability to do that on every action is a very strong power. The unfortunate reality is that putting up this card as a loss just doesn't fit that well into what we're trying to accomplish. If we want to consume shadows for value as part of our build, then we don't want to spend shadows for the moderate value, we want them to produce insane value, like with Fluid Night. Conversely, if we are trying to gain value by virtue of shadows being present, then we want the top of this card instead. Even if we could play both, we can't really afford the stamina hit if we're trying to also play Call to the Abyss, Eclipse, and perhaps lose a card for a bursty turn. Finally, the movement typically won't find value as we can teleport whenever we really need a large step.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

							<p>Sunless Apparition lets us turn a shadow into a non-loss summon. Boneshaper spends health to make their skeletons; here, we spent a shadow to make our own friend. This summon has fantastic movement and damage, though it will die if a light breeze knocks it over. Expect to summon this late, have it run in and hit once, then die to an attack next round. Still, even in this worst case, this is effectively turning a shadow into an attack 3, disarm that also marks the target. If the summon happens to hit two or more times, this is insane value. We actually love the slow initiative here, because we want to summon late and then go quick next turn. If the summon dies before we get to hit, we're not very happy with it, so try to avoid that.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is our first teleport, and it comes with a loot. The loot being before the movement means you'll need to move into position the previous turn, which is awkward if we're just teleporting away immediately, so don't expect this loot to get a lot of value if movement is at a premium. Still, being able to teleport across the map means you don't need to bring much movement for yourself if you're spending time moving your shadows anyway.</p>

							<p>Another reward for keeping shadows on the map: an attack three stemming from each one. This requires the shadows to be precisely positioned to reach full value, but if you can make this an attack 15 at level 1, this loss can't be beat. The fact that you can use multiple shadows to hit the same target means it is easier than it looks to get massive value here. I wouldn't use this for three or fewer attacks, but 4 or 5 are absolutely worth your time.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action gives us our first opportunity to manipulate shadow position. Move ourself two, then move each shadow a single hex. This isn't a ton of shadow movement, but it's good enough to position shadows already on the battlefield into slightly more advantageous positions. The main benefit here is that it lets us move as well, so for actions such as Shadow Step, where we need to be in a shadow, this is a nice way to line up the action. It's not really enough movement to move shadows from room to room, so we will either need to abandon our shadows or bring some additional options.</p>

We don't care much about moving ourself, so we rely on Dark Fog and Black Barrage to move our shadows around. Dark Fog is more important early, as it's difficult for us to move our shadows from room to room and we don't really need more than one or two in position at once anyway.

					<p>Fluid Night and Forceful Spirits are our best attacks by a wide margin. We shouldn't ever be in danger, so we won't need the bottom of Fluid Night. Forceful Spirits does require us to get reasonably close to the fight but we should be able to coordinate so either our tank secures our safety, or else we kill the enemies in question. Anger of the Dead serves as our way to convert excess shadows into value before we have the cards to move them to the next room, as well as a great source of XP. When used on a shielded enemy, we're getting good value for our shadows.</p>

					<p>Remember to leave no shadow behind. At the end of a room, you have two choices: try to move all of your shadows to the next room, or consume them all to avoid losing value (both damage and experience). Moving them all is slow for us now as we can only move one shadow more than 3 hexes for the entire rest cycle, so unless they're already near the doorway I'd go the other route until we're higher level. We can consume all of our shadows with Anger of the Dead for a huge chunk of XP, potentially summoning as well with Sunless Apparition if we have the time and the right hand size. It's often worth leaving behind one shadow, pushing it forwards with Dark Fog, and then either using it for Fluid Night or teleporting to it when you need to advance.</p>

							<p>Ritual Sacrifice is not likely to do more than Strength of the Abyss much of the time. It has a base of two more damage, but requires the shadows to be precisely positioned. We need three shadows to tie the level one card, and four to beat it. Still, that card was borderline busted at level 1, so even if we're just picking up a second copy with a bit of variability (and a much stronger initiative), we're content. Pair this with the bottom of Wave of Anguish for maximal positioning.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom will frequently just be a move two that creates dark, which, much like the top was a spinoff of Strength of the Abyss, is often a second copy of Call of Doom with a slightly weaker action and a much stronger initiative. The bonus to add some shield is cute. We don't really want to use this on ourself, and it's difficult to predict the turns where you will want a large shield, so the use cases for this are rare. Still, you can use this to create a supertank for a turn, especially if someone has retaliate up, and you can hoover up shadows you know you won't be able to rescue for some free XP.</p>

							<p>Well, the top action looks much like that of Lingering Rot. Wound is often a little better than poison, and we don't lose the shadow, so this action is a bit better, but not by three levels, so we wouldn't take it for the top alone even if we did rely on losses.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>To make this worth our time, we want a spammable bottom; and boy, do we get one. We can now make an extra shadow for free once per rest cycle. We could have done this instead of playing the loss on Call to the Abyss, but now we can do both. This is huge. Whenever we don't need to reposition shadows or ourself, we should use this ability.

The best use case is against a high shield, moderate health enemy that doesn't have any self-healing. Realistically, you probably won't use this until the scenario is almost over, because the bottom is so essential that it's typically not worth giving it up.</p>

We're basically never playing Eclipse's top action anymore, but it's still something we can drop in the last room for some free XP with Anger of the Dead, and our best movement option when we don't need to teleport. As a result, I'd typically cut Black Barrage here; however, if you know you won't be walking very much, then you can instead cut Eclipse, shift Black Barrage to an attack, and play Forceful Spirits as a teleport. Forceful Spirits is really the only reason we're bothering to position ourself anymore, so if you aren't using that then two teleports a cycle should be more than enough. The main reason we haven't made this choice already is that teleporting instead of moving means we'll be very loot poor, so walking around every now and again will find us the resources we need.</p></div>

							<p>Just as Ritual Sacrifice was to Strength of the Abyss, so too is Dominate to Fluid Night. It is almost strictly better, with plus one damage and a chance to disarm, but not a huge amount better, and costs a dark instead of making one. 6 damage will kill often enough that we can frequently discount the disarm, and one extra damage isn't a major improvement. However, remember that Fluid Night is busted at level one, so we're beyond happy to just get a second copy that trades dark for damage. And if you are attacking some very tanky enemies, this disarm will do some fantastic work.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is yet another instance of move and darkness, this one being a bit longer range. It's easy to discount the power here, but this is our only other move 4 so far besides Eclipse. That's not insignificant.</p>

							<p>An attack 3, boosted to 5 with dark, that generates a bonus shadow if it kills. That'll make two shadows with Call to the Abyss, so this is a very efficient use of our time. The fact that we require the kill means you will want the dark to try and guarantee it, and if you have an ability to get advantage you'll want to use it here.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Meanwhile, the bottom action is amazing. If you were only ever moving one shadow at once, this lets you do it for free. This won't get your shadows from room to room, this won't line up your shadows into precise patterns, but if you just need one shadow in a certain place each round, this does it for you.

							<p>I'm a sucker for summons, so I love the top of The Night Takes Shape. This summon will probably live through two hits due to its disadvantage and decent health, and if you have your other summon, they both get the bonus. However, this summon doesn't hit harder or move further than your level one summon, and the cost of a second shadow does hurt. This is a great way to translate your shadows in a room into power in the next room (assuming you will be at an odd hand size if you pulled this card back), but not something that I would prioritize unless the shadows are going to waste anyway.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action, which is fantastic. We have seen some bottom sources of damage, but this is our first and only bottom attack, which also moves both us and a shadow. You don't need to use the teleport if you're already in the right spot, so this only costs a shadow if you need that part. Of course, if you are standing still, you'll need to hit hard enough that the enemy will reliably die, and you'll need to do it quickly.</p>

							<p>Vengeful Storm is a clean upgrade to Anger of the Dead. Attack three is an above average use for shadow consumption, and the tempo gained by this action is huge. Besides, you should be able to line up enough kills with this that you won't actually lose as many shadows as you spend; as with our other multitarget options, be sure to target the potential kills first for maximum shadows. You can't consume a shadow that you create to add additional targets, as you need to consume all targets before the start of the action, but six attack threes is an absolutely phenomenal use of your time.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Stun things in a large AOE and wound them, all but guaranteeing at least two direct damage each. The top is good enough that we don't want to give this up unless we're getting insane value, but if we can stun five or more enemies we're happy to pivot.</p>

							<p>The top is a simple, effective action. It's a similar power level to Fluid Night, but it hits two targets instead of one and doesn't cost us a shadow. The pull can be nice to get things into position for actions like Deepening Despair, and if you're lucky, the first action kills a target, netting you two shadows.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is definitely not something you build around, but if you can get off five heals and five blesses on characters that need them, this action does great work. I wouldn't use it unless you can get all five and remove a few conditions, as the stamina cost is definitely significant.</p>

							<p>Proliferation of the Abyss' top action is a slight upgrade to Fluid Night. We can use it to protect an ally (near a shadow) instead of ourself, which makes this action great for a support build. And if you have dark, you get a spare shadow. It doesn't feel like enough of an upgrade to justify putting a level 1 action on the top of a level 7 card. Still, setting this up between rooms is a fine use of our time.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is a strong upgrade to Wave of Anguish, allowing us to reposition ourself and our shadows all at once. It's a shame we don't get XP for this darkness, but it's likely we'll be able to get value without the extra movement enough of the time.</p>

However, this isn't much better than our existing attacks, and we do actually have enough of them now that if we aren't getting value out of the pulls this is a mediocre choice.<p>You could go back to levels 5 or 6 and take The Night Takes Shape if you really like summons, or Medium if you feel like you want to prioritize your bottom actions for things that aren't shadow movement (such as looting). In particular, I would recommend taking Medium if you took Restless Spirits back at level two, since that's something more to do on bottom.</p><p>Hungry Grasps does exactly the same thing as Forceful Spirits, except it doesn't require us to position ourself or to consume dark. Still, Forceful Spirits is a powerful attack and our best teleport, so we'll cut Sunless Apparition instead. Now that we have Vengeful Storm, we don't really need the summon to find high value from our shadows; it is slightly better than one extra attack three, but not enough extra to cost us a whole extra turn.</p></div>

							<p>This top provides an absurd amount of crowd control. You can very quickly immobilize a huge group of monsters. The monsters then suffer one or two direct damage. Note that this targets all immobilized enemies, not just those you immobilized with this ability. Don't stress too much about the dark; you get the XP one way or the other, and the immobilize is typically more important than the damage here.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action lets us create and reposition shadows. At this point, we should be able to make enough shadows using our attacks, Call to the Abyss, and non-loss shadow generation, but if we need a very high tempo opening to a scenario or to a new room, this card perfectly fits the bill. I'd recommend using this action in scenarios with lots of ranged enemies, so that giving up the immobilize isn't a huge cost.</p>

							<p>The bottom is a strong, spammable action. Reposition your shadows, and get three or five damage as a bottom action. We typically want the shadows close to enemies anyway, so we're often killing two birds with one stone here. Just be careful: since the damage is not an attack, it does not mark enemies to make shadows, so we usually want to use this on something we've already marked or something that won't die straightaway.</p>

							<p>The top represents an epic reward for careful shadow positioning. Theoretically, this represents attack 19, which is of course unparalleled for a non-loss action. Of course, this requires lining up five shadows, spending them all, and increasing the range of your movement with powerful boots not available early in the game. More realistically, this will be an attack ten or thirteen, which is still plenty! Three damage per shadow meets the same threshold as Vengeful Storm at level six, but piling it all into one attack makes us better at taking out bosses and tanky, shielded enemies.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>When surrounded by a multitude of weak enemies, the top will probably be overkill, at which point we can use the bottom. Lining up 3-4 curses is extraordinarily powerful, and the fast initiative means you can ensure you get in there before the enemies de-clump.</p>

							<p>The top represents a fairly weak attack, followed by a huge amount of damage when the target dies. If you manage to kill the target, you get an immediate shadow from Call to the Abyss, and you get the damage splash in what is hopefully an optimal location. If you don't kill the target (a much more likely outcome), you get a curse, which is not a small consolation.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>On bottom, you get Call to the Abyss jr. It's hard to say whether this is better or worse on average. You don't need to attack to get these shadows, but you do need darkness, which is something we could use for other effects. </p>

							<p>For those that like to stay back, When Your Time Comes is excellent.<p>A support Deathwalker could use only this bottom action and channel all of their dark into shadows.</p><p>Realistically, a Deathwalker that is attacking should be able to make enough shadows without this bottom, and will prefer the top of this card or one of the actions on Black Lance in order to use the shadows they're already making with greater efficiency. Still, between Vengeful Storm and Anger of the Dead, we could run a build where we run this loss and Call to the Abyss, and consume our shadows with absurd frequency.</p></p>

		<div class="w3-light-grey">The most important thing for us by far is consistency. We need to guarantee that we kill whenever we can, so we need to get rid of all of our negatives. The order isn't hugely significant, but I prefer to first remove my (-1)s, then replace the (-2), and then replace the remaining (-1)s.</div>

		</table><br>

		<div class="w3-light-grey">Moving a shadow on long rest is a very large benefit for us, so we'll pick that one up next. It's very frequent that this saves a shadow from becoming completely worthless. The curse and dark modifiers both do things that we like. Ideally we'll be getting kills, but we make enough little attacks that this isn't guaranteed, so the order of these two is up for personal preference. I prefer the dark modifiers first, but it's a very close call.</div>

		<div class="w3-light-grey">Everything from this point is much less important. If your party needs healing or is bad at dealing with poison/wound/etc, I would grab the heals next. If they lack CC, you can snag the disarm and muddle. If you find yourself short resting frequently, snag the short rest perk. If none of these apply, ignore scenario effects.<p>The disadvantage perk isn't bad, but the odds that we'll be taking a hit is very slim, so we take this one last.</p></div>
