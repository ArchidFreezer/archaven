		<p>This build is for being on the front line and having the enemies focus their attention on you. It doesn't really come online until level 4 so up until that point you need your allies to do their share of front line work and take some of the enemy attacks. Yopu will also shiffle your deck around a bit at this level from a bruiser type build to start tanking.</p>	<p>You use shields and retaliate as your main actions with only a few actual attacks thrown in where they can provide you either healing or token management.</p>
		<p>So why would you play a Spiky Ball Build?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You like standing on the front line toe to toe with the enemy and getting in their faces</li>
			<li>You have some damage dealers in your party who can do striking damage.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The tank build loves the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Classes like the Blinkblade who can take out priority targets as you tend to fight front to back taking out enemies as you reach them.</li>
			<li>Parties with some ranged characters so they don't clog up the tiles and let you move from enemy to enemy. Your initiative isn;t great so you don;t want swarms of summons going before you and getting adjacency to enemies you want to attack you.</li>

							<p>A ranged attack moving a token back sounds great, but without assistance the actual attack is fairly weak. The token manipulation is great though.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action adding to our healing may actually be better on a melee tanking build than a support one in some ways. The best kind of Healing is in short sporadic bursts, not one giant Heal. Smaller heals get around the all too common Poison condition without huge penalty, and many classes have small incidental healing that makes a giant Heal 5 or 6 excessive and unneeded.<p>This bottom action works with anything that gives you a Heal action, such as Long Resting (4hp baby!), Amulet of Life, <i>Regen</i> or even a Healing Potion.</p></p>

							<p>Crushing Weight boasts a powerful top persistent loss that turns every basic melee attack into an Attack 4. Note that while small rapid attacks are very efficient with this Loss in play, they will also make your tracker tick down much faster!</p>
							<hr>
							<p>A bottom Heal action that moves a token back is great value, allowing you to still attack or bulk up with your top action while ensuring that your tokens never get too close to the precarious final slot. Range 2 will be awkward at times as this is a bottom action, so you do need to be in position.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>For a melee build this is a core card. We will want the top to be up as soon as possible and need to manage the tokens to ensure it does not drop off.<p>The initiative, in line with our other persistent losses, is awful, but not something we are too concerned about given the way the card will be used.</p></p>

							<p>Long range <i>Poison</i> is never a bad thing, but as a melee build we would rather leave that type of action to someone else.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Move 4, every hand should have one of these somewhere, so unless you have the bonus +2 token slot card this is likely to be a standard pick.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This bottom is either going to be a must bring or fairly useless depending on whether we are using the bottom of Sustained Momentum or not. If we have that persistent loss running then every card turns into a Move 4, making this redundant. If we do not plan on running the slot then we will take this card for the bottom.<p>I do not expect to be running SM on many scenarios so this does become a standard pick.</p><p>The 32 initiative eminently forgettable.</p></p>

							<p>Attack 5 AoE loss. You are unlikely to get the enemies to line up nicely so you can expect maybe 3 at best and more probably 2, making this an attack 10 loss, which is reasonable but not great for a last room loss.</p>

							<p>The bottom is a ranged attack 3, though fairly short ranged and for a melee build not something we are interested in.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is the latest in a long line of double loss cards and these need to have something compelling abut them to make the cut.

							<p>A ranged attack that, without being boosted, is weak and is not much use for a melee build.</p>

							<p>Attack 5, <i>Pierce</i> is a great top that we will be happy to play every cycle. As a melee build we can generally ignore the text in the bubble outside some very specific use cases for enemies with high retaliate, but then it drops down to an attack 3 so we don't really want to be going there if we can avoid it.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is much more situational, but that's fine with combined with a great top action. This is the kind of ability I love to have access to but loathe to actually play, as it means that the scenario is probably falling by the wayside. I don't think spending 2-3 turns on setting this up and your Persistent Losses is going to be a recipe for success unless you can afford to take a couple turns off, and then you are going down to an 8 or 9 card hand. In short burst style missions this has some merit, but I don't foresee this being a staple, turn 1 Loss kind of action.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is a great combo of spammable top combined with a situation loss.<p>Even for enemies without shield the top is an attack 5 so it's always going to be useful and against shielded enemies it is an attack 7 which is immense!</p><p>The bottom is very situational, but when you need it you will be glad it's there.</p></p>

							<p>This top is our only base Heal 3 at level 1, which does mean it has the potential to be our beefiest heal if you are leaning into Continuous Health's Persistent Loss ability. Two, Initiative 20 is also a great boon, being one of our fastest actions at level 1, and something you generally want to do early. Despite this however, I suspect this is probably the most 'cut-able' level 1 Heal, as the other 2 are bottom heals and one of them moves a token back a space.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is unfortunately a little overkill on the movement side of things, especially if you have Sustained Momentum active for a casual total of Move 9. While it's obviously good value with the right Losses active, it falls into a standard problem where the Drifter simply cannot afford to play too many regular Burns. Again, this could be a good final room play to move, kill a monster, and move again and grab a chest or some loot.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>For the melee build it is not our job to be handing out group heals and though the initiative is one we will be sad to leave behind the card just does not do  enough for us to be taken over our others.</p>

							<p>This is Crushing Weight for your ranged attacks, adding both range and damage. There is only a single extra damage, but the additional range will quite often be the difference between having a target and not.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is simply great, I don't think this card will get cut early at all due to the simple fact that every character wants to move, and every Drifter wants to move tokens back.<p>Note the enhancement pip there for an extra movement.</p></p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is a core token manipulation card for the melee build, allowing us to hit an enemy and then get our CW token back.<p>There may be times when we want to use the top, but those will be few and far between.</p><p>As expected, another duff initiative on a persistent loss card.</p></p>

							<p>Shield 1, retaliate 1 isn't something we are looking to play as a bruiser. But with CW we can turn this into attack 4, which suddenly sounds much better.<p>There are a couple of pips here so we could beef this up to double both effects if we have the money. Unless you find you are taking a lot of the tanking strain there are probably better enhancements you could make.</p></p>

							<p>This is our best initiative so we will be taking it for that alone, regardless of the text on the actions and with our token cards we can make this into an attack 4 or move 4.<p>The numbers on either half are not great, but the flexibility this card gives us means it is likely to make the cut for level 1 hands.</p></p>

							<p>Ranged retaliate persistent loss. Retaliate is not a great effect outside of some specific high shield, low health enemies and in may scenarios this would chew through your tokens in a couple of rounds. However, when facing Flame Demons and the like dishing out 12 pure damage for a loss seems like a price worth paying, if only you could keep them within range 2.</p>

							<p>The bottom is pretty much what I would expect out of a 'last room' kind of Burn, where you trade longevity for immediate contribution/effort. Opening the door, spiking something at range for 3 or 4 damage, and still getting to do your top action is great, but Drifter is a class that isn't going to want to play a dearth of non-persistent Burns, due to going down to 9 or 10 cards with his Persistent Loss cards he will have in play at this point.</p>

							<p>Ever Forward introduces Regenerate which is a nice status to have for a melee build especially if they aren't going to take damage the next round either to get a double heal from it. This is a sort of general value action that Ranged Drifters in particular will love, and the Regenerate has that same diamond-and-cross pip allowing for a status effect to be added.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom of this card is a pretty sweet Heal action, and the kind of Heal I've alluded to earlier as being the style I prefer. It has a +1 enhancement pip as well to double its effectiveness, and doling out a little Heal to 3 party members within Range 3 (and can also target yourself) means that all the annoying conditions that can be 'cleansed' by Heals will not be a problem for your party.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

							<p>The top is carefully worded to ensure it doesn't trigger when it has no targets, and splash True Damage is a great way to finish off low health enemies nearby or pesky high Shield enemies like Living Spirits or the much-hated Flame Demons. Obviously it's pretty conditional: You need to make a melee attack, and the monster needs to have another monster adjacent to it. But, I still think this is going to be strong provided you are primarily doing melee attacks. Which makes it pretty obvious which build this is meant for as well.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>A reasonable move action tied to a Shield has historically been a very solid play (Brute, for example, loved this kind of action). This one can also be enhanced up to 2 Shields, for those who really want to be the Tank for their party. 17 Initiative is early, but not quite early enough to guarantee going before the monsters.</p>

							<p>This a fine bread and butter action but again, just like Barrage, isn't particularly exciting at Level 3. I think using this top action is going to be very medium unless you run it with Precision Aim, which will eat up 2 charges each time, but provided you manage your tokens well an Attack 3 Range 4 Target 2 is good value.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom of this card is where things get spicy. This is definitely a fantastic option to have available to you, especially when things go awry in the middle-late part of a scenario. The reality is that using this loss may 'save' you your two key losses from falling off mid scenario, and I imagine a Drifter that loses all of their Persistent effect is definitely going to be a bit of a lame duck as far as combat prowess is concerned. If that does happen, your options are to try and turn on another one of your Persistent actions (if they are around) and try and swap builds mid-scenario, which sounds really dicey.</p>

							<p>This is a great example of the Devs and testers being very aware of just how strong Crushing Weight is on a Melee Build, as this turns from an Attack 4 to an Attack 8 in that build, but is basically unplayable otherwise. It does have the diamond pip which should allow for most if not all enhancements, which is nice, but that will be pricey as this has multiple targets.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom continues with the awkwardness of this card, as it is a great Persistent Loss for the exact opposite build. This is actually an ability that scales hard in the higher levels of Drifter, as adding a target to the majority of your level 1 actions (or even Ever Forward from level 2), is not exciting at all. Early on, this only really pairs well with Continuous Health Top, Deadly Shot Top, and Fortitude top if you move the token forwards. It's also something you actively don't want to use with an ability like Draining Arrows, as adding Attack 1 Muddle is not worth a full charge.</p>

							<p>Chunk of Flesh has a sweet top action that kind of plays both sides of the fence, being a Melee Attack that can heal self or other adjacent allies, and obviously scales well with their respective Persistent Losses. Attack 4 Heal 2 is just going to be a good action for Melee Drifters, either topping up their own health or potentially helping out someone nearby with a nasty condition.  The token regain is unconditional as well so a solid action for us.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Although, if you are the frontliner, you will probably take this card for the bottom ability instead.... Sorry, Unbreakable, you had your time in the sun, but it's about time you left. Doubling your sources of shield on a card while having a better top action means that aside from the most dedicated of Tank Drifters, this card becomes an easy replacement for Unbreakable. I don't know if I can even recommend running both Shield Losses at once when there are so many fun and powerful Losses to play on this class, as having 2 shields instead of 3 but actually contributing to the fight is going to be more effective anyways.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>There are two great actions for a melee build and I would be nice to have them both, but ultimately the bottom is going to win out.<p>Initiative 62 sucks, but if you are using this card for its bottom, you are only seeing the number once or twice at least.</p></p>

							<p>Prey's top action is reminiscent of the conditional move token actions we got at Level 1 on the Drifter, although those were Move and Melee attacks, which means that Prey is definitely an eye catcher for Ranged Drifters. Precision Aim bumps this up to a Range 4 Attack 4, which should all but ensure you get the free token assuming you pick the right target (and don't draw a Null). This is a fantastic staple action that is a good payoff for being a Ranged Drifter, which is an archetype that will definitely burn through tokens, especially if you use both Aim and Barrage from Level 3.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is also amazing, being a Move 4 with upside, which from the starters in Frosthaven, seems like it will be a rarity until very high levels (minus Blinkblade). It does not seem difficult to kill something and move forwards afterwards to get your token back and probably grab the loot that dropped.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>The top has no place in a melee build, but we can certainly use the bottom move and  conditional token.<p>This is direct upgrade to Deadly Shot, albeit with a worse initiative, which at 40 is definitely not great, but at least it's not in the 60-70 range again.</p></p>

							<p>Break Through is an absolute house numerically, especially for a Melee Drifter. By level 5, assuming you are playing somewhere in the range of 0 to +2 difficulty, many enemies will have shields, and the ones that do so (esp. elites) may have multiple. An attack 4/6 Pierce 2 with the option to add a Wound can end up being something like an effective Attack 9 (if you count the wound as an extra damage, it will often be better than that). That's pretty absurd for a non-burn that is easily repeatable, and makes this level up kind of a nonchoice if you are Melee.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>This is before even writing about the bottom, too. Again, Move 4's with upside. This one's a little harder to trigger in my opinion than the bottom of Prey that we saw earlier, unless you are moving into the thick of battle. Regardless, it's extra text on top of an already solid action, so you'll take it. </p>

							<p>I don't think there is a world where you don't take Break Through with this build, no matter how much fun that Loot Heal action from Survivalist looks. <p>Initiative 34 is fine, although Drifter's will definitely have problems depending on card choice where the lion's share of your actions fall into the 30-70 range.</p></p>

							<p>Survivalist's top introduces Ward, a new condition that I suspect will end up being an absolute staple of any sort of Support or Tank's arsenal. Ward is also a mechanic that scales with the level and difficulty you are playing at nicely, being somewhere in the range of 2-5 damage mitigation unless you are playing at something like +2 difficulty and a big enemy crits. This action is a lot of incremental value, and if it keeps your party alive so they aren't burning cards to damage, then it's a strong option.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is super flavourful for a Drifter (as they are wandering nomads who salvage and re-appropriate for a living), but isn't a particularly exciting action by level 5. It's definitely a good value action with the right kind of Losses in play, and is never going to be bad per se, but I don't think many players will take Survivalist purely for this effect.</p>

							<p>A persistent pierce that seems particularly suited for a Ranged Drifter who has essentially no Pierce available minus some melee actions, although this doesn't preclude Melee Drifters from using this Loss as well. Because the top is pretty situational and definitely isn't something you will want in every scenario, let's look at the bottom action.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is reasonable enough, but is definitely a far cry from the Strengthen actions we've seen in the past. However, this is again something that both Melee and Ranged Drifters focused on damage probably want in their arsenal, as so far Drifter has had no access to Strengthen-style effects (Enhancement pips notwithstanding).</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This is isn't great for the melee build as we already have pierce on our attacks.<p>The Initiative on this card does it no favours, unfortunately, meaning if you plan to use this action for its bottom primarily, you will need to pair it with another card that either goes fast or slow. Overall, this is very medium for a Level 6 card.</p></p>

							<p>The top action definitely wants damage buffs such as Precision Aim active (and good modifier flips!) to really become valuable, and obviously fares particularly poorly versus Shields. This is a pretty cool action to pair with the bottom of Fierce Barrage, as getting an extra target also means a bigger heal for the target of your Heal action. An attack 2 is definitely weak by this point, so this is pretty specialized for Ranged Drifters and/or Support Drifters who also attack at range.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is a pretty sweet action when the situation lines up well, however moving the tokens back is definitely not always going to happen. The Initiative being 21 means you have a good shot at it though, as the wording means that as long as you've gone before your other allies, and a target adjacent to you dies, you get to move the token back. I feel the Retaliate is definitely extra help towards this goal, but ultimately most people will try and play this is as a move 2 that can potentially move back multiple tokens. Which is still good value when you can make it work consistently, of course.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>Consume Stamina kind of ends up being the polar opposite of Strikes above, where it focused on support and defence instead of damage.<p>The top is nothing that the melee build is interested in but we can certainly use a quick move with retaliate and a potential token management.</p></p>

							<p>Like the Wind has a top action I want to like, but I'm unsure how to fit it into a Drifter build in practice. It is dedicated for Support Drifters who probably have less use for the jump than a melee build. Given that support builds tend to throw heals out there on a regular basis this would mean that they are trying to manage two token tracks when this functionality is probably not required every time.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action is what gets me really excited for this card, and wanting to dredge up our friend from Level 1, the bottom of Sustained Momentum. Anything that turns this Move 3 into a Move 5, (even something like Boots of Striding) is going to be invaluable, as getting multiple tokens moved back on a staple move action is going to feel really good. This is the kind of ability that often makes a class 'tick' at higher levels, when you can start going nuts and using your cool stuff in a far less measured, conservative manner. Note that this says ally, which does include what will be more common NPC allies and Summons.</p>

						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">

							<p>Unending Fight would look super mediocre on pretty much any other class, but reading the card as Attack 4 Move 3 Attack 4 it is going to be good a large portion of the time. Versatility and Flexibility is the name of the game here, and this is a fantastic option for any Melee Drifter running Crushing Weight. It's an easier to set up Fierce Barrage Top that can target the same enemy twice, and also gives you a move action in between if you end up killing your primary target.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action here is pretty filler for a Level 7 Loss, as you do need to have 3 different persistent abilities active all with at least 3 Use Slots filled in. I don't find this to be an overwhelming upgrade from Dual Bow's bottom at level 3, so I think this is again the kind of action that is nice to have, but if you took Dual Bow at Level 3 this becomes far less attractive.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle w3-light-grey">
							<p>This card seems pretty good for Melee Drifters in particular, which on average I suspect will have skipped Dual Bow. Unending Fight also has a pretty nice Initiative, which is a good thing to have access to.</p>

							<p>Well, if you thought Like the Wind's bottom could move tokens back, it has gotten usurped pretty quickly. This is the kind of action that looks super gimmicky, but is obviously ridiculous for Melee Drifters, provided they hit 5 or less targets (as you move the tokens back AFTER the attacks resolve, assuming you still have Crushing Weight in play), they can essentially chain this as a massive Attack 3 AoE whenever they want it. It's important to note here that you can decline to hit enemies in the radius if you have too many where your Loss will fall off before the attacks all resolve. It's even pretty reasonable on other builds who are okay wading in close to enemies, simply to flip modifiers and move back a bunch of tokens.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom is a nice situational Persistent Loss that could definitely put in a lot of work, although my primary concern is the best enemies to do True Damage to were all squishy, high shielded ranged enemies, who typically have no reason to enter a hex adjacent to you. Not a bad thing to have available with how spammable the top action is, however.The top of this is a great token management top that can flip our modifier deck.<p>The bottom is a situational for use against those high shield, low health enemies and we can move next to them to apply the damage.</p></p>

							<p>This is definitely a pretty spicy top action, and I like that moving the token forwards to gain Immobilize will often be an easy choice, as it's usually easy to visualize whether or not Immobilize will actually impact the enemies this turn. This is definitely a build-dependant Loss, as you need to be able to move your Use Tokens back quickly after this kind of effect, but something like an Attack 5 Range 3 (with Precision Aim) Immobilize 4-5 targets is obviously great. What will ultimately determine this cards usability is how generally useful the bottom action is.</p>

							<p>The top action is definitely neat and has some obviously cool synergy with Shield actions, however in practice by Level 9 I feel like you get hit a lot more for 5+ than 1-4 damage, so it is pretty specialized in that sense. It's also awkward that it doesn't save you from the actions you are most likely to have to lose a card to, especially unexpected 2x's drawn by a monster or an untimely Brittle.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Adding an extra target to a Heal 3 Range 3 Regenerate Strengthen is pretty incredible value, and any action that can Self Strengthen repeatedly (especially when tied to other effects) is going to have my attention. This isn't the strongest action for a level 9 in the world, but it's likely going to be a workhorse.</p>

							<p>Use Every Part's top action is pretty absurd with the right coordination and positioning from your teammates, and it's hard to find fault with such an efficient action. it's good for nearly any archetype of Drifter, although obviously some are going to be more excited about it than others. Healing potentially multiple allies for 4 while dealing a pretty good amount of damage, and is another action that pairs well with Fierce Barrage's bottom.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>The bottom action definitely has a combo-sort of feel to it, as just like Just the Wind before it, this is the kind of action where you want to dump everything into moving absurdly quickly and then bashing something for like 7+ damage as a <em>bottom</em> action. It's not even difficult to envision this being more than an Attack 7, as you get to 'double dip' on the Move and Attack values both being modified by many of Drifters persistent abilities.</p>

As with Chain Hood, any form of Shield stacking alongside your persistent loss is very, very powerful. And Sturdy Greaves are much easier to use as well.

It's not realistic to think every attack will be on you, and having an extra layer of protection on your allies (or better yet, their summons) for when they do get attacked is great. This will pretty much represent the same amount of effective hit points gained as the Major Healing Potion, only spread across three figures (which is generally a bit of a downside) but with added safety (assurance against a damage spike leading to a pitched card - which is obvious upside).</p>

The choice between this and Stonewall is really going to come down to whether your party needs more protection or damage.</p>
