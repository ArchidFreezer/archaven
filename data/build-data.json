If the enemies will reach your party no matter what on round 1, then it's better to get the Shield up before they hit.

Additionally, a ranged/support Banner Spear will likely not take many hits but has a large pool of hit points to draw from, meaning the cost here is often insignificant, making this even better.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action is also incredibly useful. At the very least, it's pretty much always going to be a pre-castable Disarm, which as a non-loss bottom is great. But obviously the real value here is having an ally whose movement you control precisely who acts immediately before your turn each round, moving into position to help you set up your AoE patterns. At lower player counts or in parties without melee allies, if you're playing for a melee focus, you should consider that keeping this summon active is mandatory. And even when you have allies who can, in theory, help you, they may not always be willing to. Accordingly, look to play this bottom action as early as you can and resummon it when necessary if it dies.",

And while there is a condition on it, this is still one of your easier patterns to set up (remember that you can always mirror, flip, and rotate these patterns). So great payoff for little setup? Yes, please! What's the downside? Well, the downside is that the bottom action on this card is also incredible and deprives you of the top.",

					"overall": "Rallying Cry is another core card for every Banner Spear.<p>The big challenge is the banner doesn't move on its own, meaning you'll need to spend a fair amount of time moving it yourself. Quite simply: that is difficult to do while also moving as much as you need to in order to effectively tank or be a melee damage-dealer, which is why this will mostly just be used in a ranged/support build, outside of scenarios that take place entirely in a single room.</p>"

Without it, Attack 3, Range 3 is still a fine action and making sure you always have one ranged attack allows you to be effective even on rounds when you can't afford to run up to the enemies, so you'll always be happy to have this around even if it doesn't wow you with its damage.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is meant to help you set up your AoEs by pulling an enemy into the requisite hex while you have the rest of the pattern set up. This does sometimes work in practice, but the Move 1 is still very limiting and makes it harder to use than something like Combined Effort's bottom. Bonus movement boots would help a lot here but jump boots are essential on a melee Banner Spear, which makes this remaining at a true Move 1 sting.",
					"overall": "Javelin is a solid filler card for most builds but a core card for a ranged/support Banner Spear.<p>If you have access to enhancement, this is a good place to stick a cheap +1 Move enhancement, which can make this bottom a lot more consistently useful.</p>"

					"top": "The top action is underwhelming without Air but it's also very free for you to make Air at some point with the top of Javelin, so you can pretty consistently count on getting this powered-up once per rest cycle. At that point it's a solid action but nothing really incredible. Obviously if you have the persistent Shield 1 from Unbreakable Wall, then the synergy with Disadvantage is solid, and that gives you a good turn that combines offense and defence.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action promises a tremendous amount of Shield but is quite difficult to use. You lack top movement, which means you need to already be in position to use this from the round before. That's not necessarily difficult, but the difficult part is that it typically involves you sprinting to the front line to make sure the ranged enemies will be attacking you next round. The problem with that is that there will often also be melee enemies, and moving to the front and then not moving for the round is going to lead to getting hit by them, which you could often have avoided by just moving more safely. So overall, the bottom has incredible potential (get up to Shield 3 for the round and just shrug off all of the ranged attacks in the room) but is pretty difficult to use effectively on any consistent basis.",

Of course, that is a reasonably sized 'if', as this is one of your more difficult ally positioning requirements to pull off. If the Reinforcements are alive, it shouldn't be too difficult to make this work. Without them, you'll need an ally to stand in a specific spot for you, but then face some issues with initiative such that 06 is too fast and your ally won't be there in time but 32 or 67 are obviously too slow. So your best bet is certainly the Reinforcements or otherwise a very speedy ally like a Blinkblade.",
					"bottom": "The good news is that the bottom action is a very spammable and welcome Move 4, one of only two at level 1, meaning we'll always be happy to have this card around, and when the top lines up well against the right types of enemies, you'll get an amazing payoff at very little opportunity cost.",

If you're playing with a Banner, you'll need this to move the Banner through the scenario.

				{
					"id": "setforthecharge",
					"top": "The top action is passable if you're playing the tanking persistent loss. It should never really be a focus, but there are a couple of reasons you might play it: you can't or don't want to get all the way to the enemies to attack or you're facing enemies where direct damage is more profitable than attacking (typically enemies with high Shield or Retaliate values).",

					"top": "The top action is theoretically very powerful but is by far the most difficult pattern we have at level 1. Jump boots can help a reasonable amount (if you have an ally adjacent to an enemy you can use a Move 4 bottom with the boots to go to the other side and fulfil the pattern) but even then it can be difficult, you won't always have them available, and that will often put you in a very dangerous position. Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss. And in that case, being your highest single-target damaging attack ability certainly sits well. But most of the time, I'd just recommend not trying to play around the top.",
					"bottom": "The bottom, on the other hand, is a very solid loot action. You need supplies for Frosthaven and this can get you them. The bottom would be much better with movement boots, which you won't have on a melee Banner Spear but can pick up in a ranged/support build (of course, if you're already in melee, it's easier to move with this to pick up the loot).",

				{
					"id": "regroup",
					"top": "In between rooms this is a nice top action, and regenerate works well before a long rest as it clears Poison prior to the heal.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is fairly useless outside a Banner build, where you need all of the tools you can get to move your Banner from room to room, and a granted Move 3 is better than a Move 2. The significance of this action for the build is a big reason why the build is more ranged focused: you need to play this action once each rest cycle, and it's much easier to play it on a turn where you're performing a ranged attack or a heal than a melee attack.",
					"overall": "Regroup is another filler card for most builds although is still less valuable in that role than something like Javelin. It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter. Here, that's not really the case for any tanking or melee builds, as this lacks movement while also not having excellent initiative. Typically, something like Combined Effort will be significantly more convenient to use."
				},
				{
					"id": "resolvedcourage",
					"top": "To start, the top's pattern is typically significantly easier to pull off than the similar-but-different Tip of the Spear. It's also worth noting that this top pairs very well with summoning the Reinforcements in combat. You can play that bottom action and then have the pattern for this top set up immediately in the same round. This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies. It is theoretically possible to engineer a situation where you're able to run in late, then do this top, then run away the following round, but it requires some really precise positioning from your allies and the monsters such that I wouldn't fixate on it.</p>",
					"bottom": "Then the bottom is just a nice value action. It's not anything amazing, but being able to play this card for the bottom action to ensure you go before some monsters, and then still getting some bonus damage out of the deal is pretty sweet. The most obvious combo at level 1 is certainly with Unbreakable Wall, which both has more forgiving targeting to accommodate not moving, and also more possible targets. Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well. And lastly, don't forget to check what your allies are doing on rounds when you play this: it might be worth using this bottom after your attack for the turn if you have something like a nearby Deathwalker or Geminate ally performing a big AoE attack.",
					"overall": "Resolved Courage is an excellent card and definitely my favourite of Banner Spear's 'X' cards. It kind of has it all: strong top attack that's not too difficult to pull off, nice value bottom action, and excellent initiative."
				},
				{
					"id": "incendiarythrow",
					"top": "The top action has quite a lot of potential but does have some drawbacks. First of all, you simply cannot use this in situations where a -1 would yield no Wound because that's just too likely of a blowout. Accordingly, you need to increase the base attack value to 2, which can be done with the Banner of Strength or Resolved Courage's bottom action. Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there. Obviously you need to be mindful of scenarios with large numbers of enemies with Shield, where this is again more likely to deal no damage. Which is unfortunately because Wound is typically very good against shielded enemies.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, I'm not really sure what to make of the bottom. I've used it a bit and it's fine but it's pretty risky and doesn't have a lot of movement. I think it's fine to just throw down in some single-room extremely high tempo scenarios as a fire-and-forget bottom loss that will help out for a few turns and then eat some attacks and die, but I wouldn't really recommend worrying about it beyond that (or otherwise just for two much-needed experience on a Banner build as a throwaway loss at the end of the scenario).",

				{
					"id": "drivinginspiration",
					"top": "If you have the Banner of Strength out, the top is actually very good. When you're playing a ranged character who has some valuable non-move bottom actions like repositioning the Banner or summoning a sacrificial Reinforcement, Attack 3, Range 4 with advantage may honestly even be better than Attack 4, Range 3. Either way, you'll be happy to have them both.<p>For most builds, unless you have an ally who really needs the Light, the top just doesn't pack enough punch to justify.</p>",
					"bottom": "The Banner on the bottom is strong, its biggest drawback is just not really being as strong or essential as Banner of Strength while being another persistent loss on a 10-card class. Going down to 9 cards is perfectly viable in an average scenario, but going down to 8 cards and also having to transport both Banners through the scenario is just not going to be worth it for this Banner's added bonuses. Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).",

					"top": "The biggest frustration people have with this card is thinking they should hit two targets with it most of the time and when they don't, it's a disappointment. Not at all! While you can occasionally hit two targets thanks to your Jump boots, the vast, vast majority of uses for this top action should be a single Attack 4, Wound with a targeting pattern identical to Rallying Cry. And that's still very good! Combined Effort is an excellent top and the only thing keeping us from using it more is the bottom, but now you can have Combined Effort top and bottom, effectively.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action here is just a really convenient healing package that you can easily use when moving from room to room.",
					"overall": "Meat Grinder is a very nice package of a card.<p>Either you find an opportunity to use the top action in combat, or you still have the card in hand afterwards out of combat and you can get a reasonable amount of free healing. A great deal either way.</p>"

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is kind of a budget Regroup - while the added range and ally are nice if you're concerned with helping out your teammates, the reduced movement when doing something like moving a Banner is significantly worse. Of course, if you're moving Banners, even a budget Regroup is still a welcome addition.",

Even if you only hit a single enemy, you're still getting two Attack, Poison, four Healing, and an experience. And it's not very difficult to hit two enemies most of the time.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, is rather niche. It helps to enable a really powerful combo at level 9 and otherwise can just be thrown down in single-room defence scenarios. But otherwise, if you're focused on using Banners, Banner of Strength is going to give you more value that's also easier to use most of the time. While Shield 1 against all enemies attacks is inherently more powerful than +1 Attack on one attack per character, the restriction of needing to keep this adjacent to whoever is taking those attacks for it to be effective is just too much work for it to be worth it in most scenarios.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is just great though - you'll be happy to have this action every rest cycle. You actually lack a late initiative big move (the 67 on Tip of the Spear is not late enough to be reliable), so this fills that hole while providing a bunch of bonuses.

So yeah, if you take this card, you take it for the bottom action, which you'll be more than happy to use every single rest cycle, and then maybe in one out of every five times you play this card, you'll be able to set up the top and get an amazing payoff.</p>"

It's less that you're going to somehow put yourself in the middle of 5-6 enemies with an ally, and more having three extra hexes gives you more flexibility for targeting and will on average net you one additional target. Definitely a reasonable upgrade. Of course, that's not really what makes the card appealing.",

Between Explosive Epicenter and Boldening Blow, you have enough granted movement by now to make this happen. Unfortunately, there's often going to be a pretty real drawback as well - frequently one of your two allies that helps you with this pattern is going to be the Reinforcement. It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up. If you don't have enough melee allies who are consistently around you, then it's not going to be worth it. And while the payoffs seem like exactly what a tank would want, the tank build just isn't set up to provide enough movement to make this happen regularly (and even then, you'd be putting the allies you're tanking for in pretty risky spots to get the payoff).",
					"bottom": "The better action on Barricade by a reasonable margin is the bottom. This Banner is incredibly powerful - it's just a free Disarm every single round as long as you can keep it next to someone who will get attacked at least once in the round. That's not very difficult to do. And then it has some nice synergies with self-damage, like the Boneshaper's level 6 summon that makes her suffer six damage. It's so easy to set this up to negate that and that's such a huge swing for the Boneshaper.",
					"overall": "Accordingly, what are the use cases for actually taking Barricade at 6?<p>If you're going to spend a lot of time at level 9. The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well. In any of these cases, just treat Bolstering Shout as Barricade for the rest of the guide.</p>"

					"id": "leadfromafar",
					"top": "The +2 Attack is significant if it is powered up. Obviously, we need to have melee allies adjacent to enemies to make this work. The Reinforcement and the Bird can both help with this although we can't really count on both of them all of the time, so it's important to have at least one melee ally. Of course, if you're playing a Banner-focused build, it's likely you have one or more (anyone call for a Boneshaper?) And lastly, once we get to level 9, we'll have a very easy combo to set this up.",
					"bottom": "Ranged summons are historically very, very powerful in any Gloomhaven game. They just sit around, pretty much never dying, immune to almost all Retaliate (the bane of most normal summons), consistently outputting damage. With Range 4, this will attack safely pretty much every turn. Move 2 is generally enough, although can sometimes lag behind. Fortunately, most of your granted movement has an extra target, so you can move this and a Banner through the scenario at the same time. And then it also adds a small amount of free mitigation as a bonus with the Muddle, which is far from necessary but certainly welcome.",
					"overall": "Lead from Afar is the grown up version of Pinning Charge's top, but only of real use for the Banner build."
				},

					"id": "sweepingaid",
					"top": "This is the Resolved Courage pattern except with the gray and blue hex swapped. I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.",
					"bottom": "The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions. Now, how much better than Meat Grinder bottom is this really? Definitely better, although probably not the difference between level 2 and level 8 better. Although I think this says more about how great Meat Grinder bottom is at level 2 than necessarily being a condemnation of this at level 8. I'd take this at level 8 and always be happy to have this action. If Taunting Howl didn't exist.",

Here we get an excellent amount of movement (9 in total!) while also going at a speedy 11 initiative. It's everything you could ever want. Suddenly, setting up the top of Tri-Thrust doesn't seem so difficult. And right now, you're probably saying 'But Gripeaway, you skipped the top!' To which I'll just respond 'Did I?'",

Sure, Poison is useful against them, but spending a fair amount of setup and your level 9 card just to apply AoE Poison and maybe a tiny bit of damage against them isn't great. The key here is the number of our modifier cards that will be drawn.",
					"bottom": "Fortunately, the bottom is excellent against enemies with Shield by virtue of being direct damage. It has huge range and a lot of health so it's unlikely to die and it's pretty likely to damage most enemies in most rounds of the scenario. While it might seem like it's not a big upgrade over Banner of Strength, it's worth considering the number of enemy turns vs ally turns. Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength. And by being at the start of each enemy's turn, you always get the damage at an effective time rather than relying on character initiative. The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.",
					"overall": "It's hard to look at Take No Prisoners and not just start chuckling in amusement. It's just pretty absurd. And it would be justifiably difficult to set up if only we hadn't just taken Taunting Howl."

					"id": "hailofspears",
					"top": "Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.</p>",
					"bottom": "And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears. Of course, given the stamina you already lost from the beginning, this won't work for long, but obviously it's better than having the top of Hail of Spears and no Banners.",
					"overall": "Even with the absurdity of Take No Prisoners, Hail of Spears certainly holds its own and then some."

Attack 1 may not seem like a lot, but getting one every round of combat, especially when paired with your natural ability to Poison a lot of enemies, adds up to a ton of damage over the course of a scenario with very minimal upkeep.

The Dark consumption for Pierce 2 is also a very welcome bonus as we often struggle to deal with enemies with shield, especially at lower levels, and we have a couple of easy sources of Dark already at level 1.",
					"bottom": "The bottom loss is exactly how you want to set up single-use loss actions. Pairing a single-use loss with a spammable top means that we can have access to this loss for when we need at essentially zero opportunity cost. And this bottom loss is perfectly fine - an Attack 5 is certainly not a worthwhile loss as a top action, but as a bottom action at level 1 on a 12-card class, it's definitely acceptable.

And worst-case, if you bring this card and there doesn't end up being a need for the bottom, you're just stuck with the very good top action, so it's a pretty great deal. I will note that it's happened much more often to me that I've tried to get away with not playing this when 'maybe I should but maybe I don't need to' and ended up regretting it than the opposite of having played it and not needing it in the end.</p>"

That being said, it's not quite that simple as we do both need to give up a Skeleton and have the Skeleton in an appropriate location. Giving up a Skeleton can certainly be acceptable if you kill an enemy that would have killed the Skeleton anyway and with a big loss attack like this, that's not unrealistic. As for positioning the Skeleton, you'll most commonly want to combo this top with the bottom of Approach Oblivion. Regardless, the top of this card is not what makes me want to bring it.",
					"bottom": "It's also not necessarily the bottom action either. The bottom action is certainly interesting. Two AoE direct damage is quite good. The downside is that you're not super fast yourself with this (going at 21) so many of your allies will have gone before you. And all of your summons naturally go before you. So the greatest difficulty with this bottom is making sure you trigger it. Obviously you can set this up first then kill an enemy with a top command action - something like Command the Wretched - but 2-3 damage is often not going to be enough. Your melee allies also won't really appreciate triggering this for you. Of course, your summons are mostly melee but at the same time a 3-hp Skeleton and a 1-hp Skeleton are very similar in terms of effectiveness, so it's not the end of the world if they get a bit dinged up exploding some corpses. All-in-all, this is powerful and quite free to play but also harder to use than you would expect, making it fine but not great.",
					"overall": "Exploding Corpse is just fine.<p>We're not unhappy with this card just because of the initiative. At level 1, this is our second-fast initiative, just behind our 18. So while I'm not overly concerned about the value I'm going to get from the top action or bottom action here, just having this around to go at 21 initiative is going to be good enough, whether that's for a Move 2, to set up the bottom in the hopes of getting some free direct damage, or sometimes even to play the top. When you control 2-3 summons in addition to having your own turn, being able to go early in the round can be a huge swing, and definitely justifies making sure we bring some fast initiatives when we can.</p>"

Think about it like this: if you get an average of Heal 1.5 from this each rest cycle and you use it during six rest cycles, that's 4-5 additional Skeletons you'll be able to summon during the scenario. It really does add up. And don't overly focus on the bonus heal here, try to get it if you can, but the most important thing is just making sure you find the chance to play this more than anything, triggering the bonus regularly can be challenging.",

If you're desperate, sitting around at 1 or 2 hit points and you can't get anything going because you can't summon, you may be willing to play this with the level 1 summons sometimes. In those cases, it will be acceptable, although not exciting. Where this gets really interested is when you hit level 6 and can use this to negate the six damage, at which point you're looking at a loss Heal 10 self (or sometimes even Heal 14), which is certainly something this class can be in the market for. Unfortunately, by that time, you typically also already have a number of other losses you want to play, so I still only end up running that combo if my other losses don't look good in that scenario or the scenario is quite short.",

There's not much more to say about it than that: with one of your signature summons on top, a spammable and always-welcome Move 4 on bottom, and solid late initiative, this is definitely one of your best level 1 cards. The only catch with this card is that you need to be careful when evaluating your total movement for a scenario: obviously if you summon with the top action, you won't have access to this Move 4, so you need to consider that this won't be a big move ability for you as often as you think when building your hand."

With your hand size you can certainly afford it and it's often better to play a loss like this than try to be greedy, play too slow, take a bunch of damage and be stuck unable to summon afterwards. But after the first two turns, I'd pretty much just ignore the top action and just keep this card around for the bottom and its initiative.",

And remember, both effects are more useful for you than many other classes: you'll almost always have allies to strengthen because you have your summons, and Poison adds a significant amount of damage for you as you make a lot of smaller hits with your Skeletons.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also very good, although more so for one specific build. First of all, this bottom is a net of three hit points and Dark as a bottom heal action, which is honestly amazing. The catch is that you have more difficulty healing yourself than most and if you're trying to summon numerous Skeletons, you have more need of hit points than most. Accordingly, while the effect is very powerful, it's merely an average action in Skeleton-based builds. For single-summon builds, where you don't summon many Skeletons, your hit points are a much less precious resource, and this functions more like a Heal 4 or 5, which is incredible.  It is, unfortunately, only let down by its terrible initiative, especially as you lack fast non-loss top combat actions at low level, meaning the turn you play this for its bottom action will usually be a risky one.",

Obviously it can work out, but all of this to say that Eternal Torment is just generally the better version, and it makes Dark to boot. Still, if you're more interested in having one summon attack often rather than summoning a large army of summons, this has what you need. And in the single-summon build, this top really is quite good: your summon moves for the turn, performs an Attack 3, then you command it to attack with this and it performs an Attack 4. Attack 7 non-loss total for the turn at level 2 (the single-summon build goes from level 2) is pretty excellent.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is similarly quite good in a single-summon build and pretty poor outside of it (so really just a perfect card for that niche). Skeletons are disposable so you don't care that much about making sure they don't get into bad spots. Accordingly, they may take some unnecessary punishment, but that's normally not the end of the world to you. Setting up a loss to keep them alive when they may waste some number of charges is not really super appealing, although obviously it can still be very good against bosses. Lastly, the initiative isn't particularly useful for the bottom, but being able to go late when you want your beefy loss summon to run up and hit an enemy is nice, so the initiative can be useful for the top.",

					"bottom": "The bottom doesn't really matter, at least not until later, if you're taking this card for a single-summon build, and I don't think it's enough to take this for a Skeleton-based build. The problem is that the bottom is just kind of awkward for a number of reasons. You can't perfectly control where your summons go, making an AoE like this hard to aim. When the AoE is a top action, you can use a bottom move command to get the summon into position, but the only way to get this into position with a top action is to use something like Command the Wretched, but then you're also attacking before poisoning, which is again awkward. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, you don't have top in-combat actions with good initiative, meaning you'll need to do this late, but obviously it's better to poison enemies early in a round so that your party can take advantage of it. All-in-all, this is a very powerful effect for a level 2 non-loss action, but the power level is significantly balanced out by the awkwardness of using it.",
					"overall": "Unearthed Horror is the key card for the single-summon build at levels 2-4. It might not seem at a glance like it's really that much better than a Skeleton, but consider that most of your attacking consists of commanding summons to attack."

					"bottom": "Bone Dagger's bottom, on the other hand, is much easier to use with a better initiative. We have enough non-loss sources of Dark at level 1 that we can get the bonus range here often enough when we want it and sometimes you won't even need it. You also don't even need to always get the free summon from this bottom action - just getting a free curse while going at 29 initiative for the round is pretty good. After all, we're carrying around Move 3's just to have a 26, I'll certainly take a curse with substantial upside at 29.",

The damage value from this attack makes it easily worth losing a Skeleton.",
					"bottom": "Then on the bottom of Putrid Cloud is just an incredible persistent loss. If your Skeletons are going to take a significant number of hits in the scenario because you don't have allies on the front line absorbing hits for them, this will pretty much always pay for itself to an excellent degree. Now tanking hits with Skeletons feels great - you're getting disarms and retaliate damage from your summons. And again, poison has natural synergy with your Skeletons in the first place, increasing their attacks by 50%. This persistent loss is the basis for an entire build on this class and I think that build is very, very good in many parties.",

It is the core card for my favourite build, although that's the bottom.<p>The initiative is actually very welcome as well, not just that it's another in the 20's, but I've mentioned over and over how we don't have any fast top combat actions, and now we can have one of those, even if 28 isn't stellar, which will make many of our bottom actions better.</p>"

There are three primary things I'd look for:<p><ol> <li>Will you be level 8 for a reasonable amount of time? Your best cursing ability is at level 8 and a decent one is at level 7. If you have access to that, you're already pretty close to getting there with this.</li> <li>A +1 Range enhancement on the bottom of Damned Horde. That enhancement makes it pretty realistic to get two more curses per rest cycle.</li> <li>An ally (or allies) who curse. Obviously if we can't really get there ourself, if we have some help to bridge the gap between ~5 curses and 8-10, we can justify this.</li> <p>If you have any two of the three above, I would seriously consider taking Critical Failure and building around the bottom in a Skeleton Swarm build.</p>"

But it's also just a powerful effect - if you have a tank or tanky ally in your party, giving them this for the turn, with one or even zero elements, can bridge the gap to them being just tanky enough for the round.",

Getting to go this early in the round and guarantee that one of your summons will survive at least one hit is something every summoner would be happy to have. Obviously it does come with a serious cost - at least for a Skeleton build - but as it's the same cost as just summoning another Skeleton, this is still like getting to summon an in-position Skeleton with a bottom action, which is great. And then in the single-summon build, this is even better. That build cares a lot more about keeping its summons alive and the hit point cost is also much less significant, making this bottom action one of our best actions for that build at any level.",

And shield is common enough (and a significant enough issue for Skeleton builds) that pierce as also welcome damage. This just makes Skeletons a lot better at what they do, which is essentially what you do, all at the cost of going from 12 cards to 11, which is a steal.

The movement is more difficult to evaluate generally and that's just a case-by-case thing. All of this to say: while Solid Bones is amazing to have active, you shouldn't just throw it up every single scenario without thinking about it - there will be some scenarios (or points in a build) where it's not worth playing, even if not many.

You'll definitely want to try to grab some healing items or if your allies can give you a timely Ward before you do this, it would be great. If you don't have access to much healing or Ward in your available items and allies, you should seriously consider using Life in Death's bottom then to help pay for this (activate that bottom the turn you summon this the first time, then try to do just one more summon with it and then this again if you can, although even if you just use it for this and then two normal summons that's also okay).",

					"top": "The top action allows you to mark any enemy attacked by you or one of your summons. When a marked enemy dies, you may create a shadow in the figure's hex or in an adjacent hex. It is important to note that you do not have to be the one to land the killing blow; it is enough to mark an enemy, then have an ally, trap, wound, or other source of damage finish them off. You can only have one enemy marked at once, so when you attack a different enemy, you must choose (before pulling your modifier) whether to move the mark or leave it on the previous target. Remember that when performing multi-target attacks, you can choose the order of targets; whenever practical, you should choose to first attack targets that have a chance of dying, so that you can generate shadows from the kills and leave the last enemy marked. This will be the first or second action you play in nearly every scenario in every level of every build path. Through this action, you can consistently generate somewhere in the range of 3-5 shadows in a longer rest cycle, depending on how much health the enemies have.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action reliably makes exactly one shadow per rest cycle. In some scenarios where the first room is extremely dangerous and your team needs you to act immediately, you can get away with using this on your first turn and doing something with shadows right away. In general, we would like to avoid using this, not because the action is bad, but because of the opportunity cost of not being able to use the top. Not having the top for an entire rest cycle will feel very bad, as you will make one shadow on bottom but lose at least two or three from the top.",
					"overall": "Call to the Abyss is a 100% mandatory card for any Deathwalker. This is your only way to repeatedly make shadows at lower levels, and without shadows, your power is greatly diminished.<p>We would love to play both halves, and if you had an item or ally that can recover a card for you, you could open with the bottom of this card on the first round, recover the card, and play the top on turn two or three.</p>"

If there aren't low HP enemies that are likely to die in the first two rounds, you are going to be struggling without shadows at the start of the scenario. Eclipse can help you come online a bit faster. Because this isn't on the same card as Call to the Abyss, we can even do both!</p>",

If your plan is to traverse the map by teleporting, then this probably won't make a very large difference. If, however, you need to walk from place to place, or need to traverse a room but not the whole map, then this action is fantastic. As a result, we're more than happy to lug this around in scenarios where we don't need it in the first room, and drop it in the last room. It will cost us a loss, but it will save us many turns of repositioning the shadows from room one into room three, and that's a win.",

It'll definitely take a few turns to get there, especially if we don't run the loss on eclipse, but once we've got them, it'll be pretty easy for us to keep them up. Unless we're running something like Anger of the Dead that consumes multiple shadows at once, we typically expect our shadow gain to be net positive, so it's still going to be worth it to spend a shadow here or there for some extra value, but the bar for that value is that much higher now that the shadow will also cost us one damage on this attack if we don't replace it.",

Getting the ability to do that on every action is a very strong power. The unfortunate reality is that putting up this card as a loss just doesn't fit that well into what we're trying to accomplish. If we want to consume shadows for value as part of our build, then we don't want to spend shadows for the moderate value, we want them to produce insane value, like with Fluid Night. Conversely, if we are trying to gain value by virtue of shadows being present, then we want the top of this card instead. Even if we could play both, we can't really afford the stamina hit if we're trying to also play Call to the Abyss, Eclipse, and perhaps lose a card for a bursty turn.

In particular, I would recommend taking Medium if you took Restless Spirits back at level two, since that's something more to do on bottom.</p><p>Hungry Grasps does exactly the same thing as Forceful Spirits, except it doesn't require us to position ourself or to consume dark. Still, Forceful Spirits is a powerful attack and our best teleport, so we'll cut Sunless Apparition instead. Now that we have Vengeful Storm, we don't really need the summon to find high value from our shadows; it is slightly better than one extra attack three, but not enough extra to cost us a whole extra turn.</p>"

					"The Banner build emphasizes the Banners aspect of the Banner Spear, planning on deploying a Banner on the first round of the scenario and keeping it in the middle of the group till the end. Because the build needs to use its bottom actions to shepherd the otherwise immobile Banner through the scenario, this build will lean more heavily on ranged attacks and ranged support actions, rather than melee attack abilities which require more personal movement.<p>This build is a bit light on experience gain. At the start we don't have many non-loss xp generators so At All Costs is important to play each rest cycle for its experience generation on either half.</p>"

				"benefits": [
					"Your group's coordination and communication is the number one determining factor in whether a Banner build can work for you. In Frosthaven, you can freely discuss everything except giving specific names or numbers. That means you can show precise hexes you need people to occupy, or where you're going, etc. If your group prefers to avoid this sort of communication, or if your allies prefer to focus largely on their own character and are unlikely to work with you to set up some formations, you would be much better off playing a Spear build.",

				"preferences": [
					"Boneshaper. The Banner of Strength can only trigger once per turn, which means someone like an AoE attacker or someone who makes a number of attacks in a turn like a Blinkblade doesn't benefit that greatly. But each of the Boneshaper's summons have an individual turn, which means they each get the bonus attack. If the Boneshaper has two Skeletons attacking, and then grants an additional attack on her turn, that would mean the Banner of Strength gives +3 attack for just a single character, which is amazing.",
					"Allies who fight in formation, like a Drifter or Geminate. Classes like Blinkblade are likely to use their high mobility to jump around the battlefield and pick off high priority targets, which may take them away from your Banner's bonus.",
					"Parties with some other front line, like a Drifter. Because a Banner build is played mostly ranged but you need to constantly be advancing your Banner, there will be many times that your Banner is in front of you, which will put it in danger if you have no other allies in front of it.",

But obviously the real value here is having an ally whose movement you control precisely who acts immediately before your turn each round, moving into position to help you set up your AoE patterns. At lower player counts or in parties without melee allies, if you're playing for a melee focus, you should consider that keeping this summon active is mandatory.

Accordingly, look to play this bottom action as early as you can and resummon it when necessary if it dies.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is meant to help you set up your AoEs by pulling an enemy into the requisite hex while you have the rest of the pattern set up. This does sometimes work in practice, but the Move 1 is still very limiting and makes it harder to use than something like Combined Effort's bottom.

At that point it's a solid action but nothing really incredible. Obviously if you have the persistent Shield 1 from Unbreakable Wall, then the synergy with Disadvantage is solid, and that gives you a good turn that combines offense and defence.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action promises a tremendous amount of Shield but is quite difficult to use. You lack top movement, which means you need to already be in position to use this from the round before. That's not necessarily difficult, but the difficult part is that it typically involves you sprinting to the front line to make sure the ranged enemies will be attacking you next round. The problem with that is that there will often also be melee enemies, and moving to the front and then not moving for the round is going to lead to getting hit by them, which you could often have avoided by just moving more safely. So overall, the bottom has incredible potential (get up to Shield 3 for the round and just shrug off all of the ranged attacks in the room) but is pretty difficult to use effectively on any consistent basis.",

If the Reinforcements are alive, it shouldn't be too difficult to make this work. Without them, you'll need an ally to stand in a specific spot for you, but then face some issues with initiative such that 06 is too fast and your ally won't be there in time but 32 or 67 are obviously too slow. So your best bet is certainly the Reinforcements or otherwise a very speedy ally like a Blinkblade.",
					"bottom": "The good news is that the bottom action is a very spammable and welcome Move 4, one of only two at level 1, meaning we'll always be happy to have this card around, and when the top lines up well against the right types of enemies, you'll get an amazing payoff at very little opportunity cost.",

Jump boots can help a reasonable amount (if you have an ally adjacent to an enemy you can use a Move 4 bottom with the boots to go to the other side and fulfil the pattern) but even then it can be difficult, you won't always have them available, and that will often put you in a very dangerous position. Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss. And in that case, being your highest single-target damaging attack ability certainly sits well. But most of the time, I'd just recommend not trying to play around the top.",
					"bottom": "The bottom, on the other hand, is a very solid loot action. You need supplies for Frosthaven and this can get you them. The bottom would be much better with movement boots, which you won't have on a melee Banner Spear but can pick up in a ranged/support build (of course, if you're already in melee, it's easier to move with this to pick up the loot).",

					"bottom": "The bottom is fairly useless outside a Banner build, where you need all of the tools you can get to move your Banner from room to room, and a granted Move 3 is better than a Move 2. The significance of this action for the build is a big reason why the build is more ranged focused: you need to play this action once each rest cycle, and it's much easier to play it on a turn where you're performing a ranged attack or a heal than a melee attack.",
					"overall": "Regroup is another filler card for most builds although is still less valuable in that role than something like Javelin. It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter. Here, that's not really the case for any tanking or melee builds, as this lacks movement while also not having excellent initiative. Typically, something like Combined Effort will be significantly more convenient to use."

					"id": "resolvedcourage",
					"top": "To start, the top's pattern is typically significantly easier to pull off than the similar-but-different Tip of the Spear. It's also worth noting that this top pairs very well with summoning the Reinforcements in combat. You can play that bottom action and then have the pattern for this top set up immediately in the same round. This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies. It is theoretically possible to engineer a situation where you're able to run in late, then do this top, then run away the following round, but it requires some really precise positioning from your allies and the monsters such that I wouldn't fixate on it.</p>",
					"bottom": "Then the bottom is just a nice value action. It's not anything amazing, but being able to play this card for the bottom action to ensure you go before some monsters, and then still getting some bonus damage out of the deal is pretty sweet. The most obvious combo at level 1 is certainly with Unbreakable Wall, which both has more forgiving targeting to accommodate not moving, and also more possible targets. Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well. And lastly, don't forget to check what your allies are doing on rounds when you play this: it might be worth using this bottom after your attack for the turn if you have something like a nearby Deathwalker or Geminate ally performing a big AoE attack.",
					"overall": "Resolved Courage is an excellent card and definitely my favourite of Banner Spear's 'X' cards. It kind of has it all: strong top attack that's not too difficult to pull off, nice value bottom action, and excellent initiative."
				},
				{
					"id": "incendiarythrow",
					"top": "The top action has quite a lot of potential but does have some drawbacks. First of all, you simply cannot use this in situations where a -1 would yield no Wound because that's just too likely of a blowout. Accordingly, you need to increase the base attack value to 2, which can be done with the Banner of Strength or Resolved Courage's bottom action. Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there. Obviously you need to be mindful of scenarios with large numbers of enemies with Shield, where this is again more likely to deal no damage. Which is unfortunately because Wound is typically very good against shielded enemies.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, I'm not really sure what to make of the bottom. I've used it a bit and it's fine but it's pretty risky and doesn't have a lot of movement. I think it's fine to just throw down in some single-room extremely high tempo scenarios as a fire-and-forget bottom loss that will help out for a few turns and then eat some attacks and die, but I wouldn't really recommend worrying about it beyond that (or otherwise just for two much-needed experience on a Banner build as a throwaway loss at the end of the scenario).",

					"id": "drivinginspiration",
					"top": "If you have the Banner of Strength out, the top is actually very good. When you're playing a ranged character who has some valuable non-move bottom actions like repositioning the Banner or summoning a sacrificial Reinforcement, Attack 3, Range 4 with advantage may honestly even be better than Attack 4, Range 3. Either way, you'll be happy to have them both.<p>For most builds, unless you have an ally who really needs the Light, the top just doesn't pack enough punch to justify.</p>",
					"bottom": "The Banner on the bottom is strong, its biggest drawback is just not really being as strong or essential as Banner of Strength while being another persistent loss on a 10-card class. Going down to 9 cards is perfectly viable in an average scenario, but going down to 8 cards and also having to transport both Banners through the scenario is just not going to be worth it for this Banner's added bonuses. Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).",

					"bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, is rather niche. It helps to enable a really powerful combo at level 9 and otherwise can just be thrown down in single-room defence scenarios. But otherwise, if you're focused on using Banners, Banner of Strength is going to give you more value that's also easier to use most of the time. While Shield 1 against all enemies attacks is inherently more powerful than +1 Attack on one attack per character, the restriction of needing to keep this adjacent to whoever is taking those attacks for it to be effective is just too much work for it to be worth it in most scenarios.",

It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up.

That's not very difficult to do. And then it has some nice synergies with self-damage, like the Boneshaper's level 6 summon that makes her suffer six damage. It's so easy to set this up to negate that and that's such a huge swing for the Boneshaper.",
					"overall": "Accordingly, what are the use cases for actually taking Barricade at 6?<p>If you're going to spend a lot of time at level 9. The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well. In any of these cases, just treat Bolstering Shout as Barricade for the rest of the guide.</p>"

Javelin offered the same idea at level 1 but with only Move 1, was much more difficult to use. Here with Move 3 and an extra target, the utility is regularly there. And beyond that, the bottom can also be used to pull enemies away from your fragile allies.",

The Reinforcement and the Bird can both help with this although we can't really count on both of them all of the time, so it's important to have at least one melee ally. Of course, if you're playing a Banner-focused build, it's likely you have one or more (anyone call for a Boneshaper?) And lastly, once we get to level 9, we'll have a very easy combo to set this up.",
					"bottom": "Ranged summons are historically very, very powerful in any Gloomhaven game. They just sit around, pretty much never dying, immune to almost all Retaliate (the bane of most normal summons), consistently outputting damage. With Range 4, this will attack safely pretty much every turn. Move 2 is generally enough, although can sometimes lag behind. Fortunately, most of your granted movement has an extra target, so you can move this and a Banner through the scenario at the same time. And then it also adds a small amount of free mitigation as a bonus with the Muddle, which is far from necessary but certainly welcome.",

I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.",
					"bottom": "The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions. Now, how much better than Meat Grinder bottom is this really? Definitely better, although probably not the difference between level 2 and level 8 better. Although I think this says more about how great Meat Grinder bottom is at level 2 than necessarily being a condemnation of this at level 8. I'd take this at level 8 and always be happy to have this action. If Taunting Howl didn't exist.",

Suddenly, setting up the top of Tri-Thrust doesn't seem so difficult. And right now, you're probably saying 'But Gripeaway, you skipped the top!' To which I'll just respond 'Did I?'",

					"bottom": "Fortunately, the bottom is excellent against enemies with Shield by virtue of being direct damage. It has huge range and a lot of health so it's unlikely to die and it's pretty likely to damage most enemies in most rounds of the scenario. While it might seem like it's not a big upgrade over Banner of Strength, it's worth considering the number of enemy turns vs ally turns. Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength. And by being at the start of each enemy's turn, you always get the damage at an effective time rather than relying on character initiative. The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.",

					"top": "Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.</p>",
					"bottom": "And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears.

You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when leveling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.",

					"You have a number of melee allies, whether melee characters like a Drifter or Blinkblade, or someone who summons a swarm of melee allies like a Boneshaper.

					"Allies who fight in formation, like a Drifter or Geminate.

Additionally, a ranged/support Banner Spear will likely not take many hits but has a large pool of hit points to draw from, meaning the cost here is often insignificant, making this even better.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action is also incredibly useful. At the very least, it's pretty much always going to be a pre-castable Disarm, which as a non-loss bottom is great. But obviously the real value here is having an ally whose movement you control precisely who acts immediately before your turn each round, moving into position to help you set up your AoE patterns. At lower player counts or in parties without melee allies, if you're playing for a melee focus, you should consider that keeping this summon active is mandatory.

					"bottom": "The bottom is meant to help you set up your AoEs by pulling an enemy into the requisite hex while you have the rest of the pattern set up. This does sometimes work in practice, but the Move 1 is still very limiting and makes it harder to use than something like Combined Effort's bottom.

At that point it's a solid action but nothing really incredible. Obviously if you have the persistent Shield 1 from Unbreakable Wall, then the synergy with Disadvantage is solid, and that gives you a good turn that combines offense and defence.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action promises a tremendous amount of Shield but is quite difficult to use. You lack top movement, which means you need to already be in position to use this from the round before. That's not necessarily difficult, but the difficult part is that it typically involves you sprinting to the front line to make sure the ranged enemies will be attacking you next round. The problem with that is that there will often also be melee enemies, and moving to the front and then not moving for the round is going to lead to getting hit by them, which you could often have avoided by just moving more safely. So overall, the bottom has incredible potential (get up to Shield 3 for the round and just shrug off all of the ranged attacks in the room) but is pretty difficult to use effectively on any consistent basis.",

If the Reinforcements are alive, it shouldn't be too difficult to make this work. Without them, you'll need an ally to stand in a specific spot for you, but then face some issues with initiative such that 06 is too fast and your ally won't be there in time but 32 or 67 are obviously too slow. So your best bet is certainly the Reinforcements or otherwise a very speedy ally like a Blinkblade.",

Boss fights will be one of the most common exceptions as you'll be fighting in a single place for some time, making it easy enough for you to eventually circle around to the other side of the boss. And in that case, being your highest single-target damaging attack ability certainly sits well. But most of the time, I'd just recommend not trying to play around the top.",

					"bottom": "The bottom is fairly useless outside a Banner build, where you need all of the tools you can get to move your Banner from room to room, and a granted Move 3 is better than a Move 2. The significance of this action for the build is a big reason why the build is more ranged focused: you need to play this action once each rest cycle, and it's much easier to play it on a turn where you're performing a ranged attack or a heal than a melee attack.",
					"overall": "Regroup is another filler card for most builds although is still less valuable in that role than something like Javelin. It's almost always valuable to have at least one out-of-combat top action to bring into scenarios for when you're between fights and Regroup is quite good for that (Regenerate pairs very nicely with being out of combat). Of course, for cards with that as a top action, you'd really prefer it to be paired with a spammable bottom action in combat, for when fights go long and/or your rest cycles get shorter. Here, that's not really the case for any tanking or melee builds, as this lacks movement while also not having excellent initiative. Typically, something like Combined Effort will be significantly more convenient to use."

					"top": "To start, the top's pattern is typically significantly easier to pull off than the similar-but-different Tip of the Spear. It's also worth noting that this top pairs very well with summoning the Reinforcements in combat. You can play that bottom action and then have the pattern for this top set up immediately in the same round. This combo works less well with other AoE patterns simply because of the initiative of those cards, but here being able to do it all at 10 initiative works wonders. You just run into position late the previous round and then you're set. The last thing to mention for the top is that the Immobilize honestly doesn't matter much and you shouldn't worry about playing around it. It's mostly just meant to be an ~2 target Attack 3, similar to Unbreakable Wall.<p>The Immobilize will mostly just give disadvantage to ranged enemies. It is theoretically possible to engineer a situation where you're able to run in late, then do this top, then run away the following round, but it requires some really precise positioning from your allies and the monsters such that I wouldn't fixate on it.</p>",
					"bottom": "Then the bottom is just a nice value action. It's not anything amazing, but being able to play this card for the bottom action to ensure you go before some monsters, and then still getting some bonus damage out of the deal is pretty sweet. The most obvious combo at level 1 is certainly with Unbreakable Wall, which both has more forgiving targeting to accommodate not moving, and also more possible targets. Otherwise, if you're trying to use Incendiary Throw's top action without the Banner of Strength, this can help out there as well. And lastly, don't forget to check what your allies are doing on rounds when you play this: it might be worth using this bottom after your attack for the turn if you have something like a nearby Deathwalker or Geminate ally performing a big AoE attack.",

					"id": "incendiarythrow",
					"top": "The top action has quite a lot of potential but does have some drawbacks. First of all, you simply cannot use this in situations where a -1 would yield no Wound because that's just too likely of a blowout. Accordingly, you need to increase the base attack value to 2, which can be done with the Banner of Strength or Resolved Courage's bottom action. Unless Wound is particularly good in the scenario or the first room presents a clump of enemies, melee builds will typically have better things to do than pair this with Resolved Courage. But a Banner build will always have the Banner of Strength out and ranged attacks are exactly what they want so this fits very well there. Obviously you need to be mindful of scenarios with large numbers of enemies with Shield, where this is again more likely to deal no damage. Which is unfortunately because Wound is typically very good against shielded enemies.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, I'm not really sure what to make of the bottom. I've used it a bit and it's fine but it's pretty risky and doesn't have a lot of movement. I think it's fine to just throw down in some single-room extremely high tempo scenarios as a fire-and-forget bottom loss that will help out for a few turns and then eat some attacks and die, but I wouldn't really recommend worrying about it beyond that (or otherwise just for two much-needed experience on a Banner build as a throwaway loss at the end of the scenario).",

When you're playing a ranged character who has some valuable non-move bottom actions like repositioning the Banner or summoning a sacrificial Reinforcement, Attack 3, Range 4 with advantage may honestly even be better than Attack 4, Range 3. Either way, you'll be happy to have them both.<p>For most builds, unless you have an ally who really needs the Light, the top just doesn't pack enough punch to justify.</p>",
					"bottom": "The Banner on the bottom is strong, its biggest drawback is just not really being as strong or essential as Banner of Strength while being another persistent loss on a 10-card class. Going down to 9 cards is perfectly viable in an average scenario, but going down to 8 cards and also having to transport both Banners through the scenario is just not going to be worth it for this Banner's added bonuses. Of course, in any short/high-tempo/single-room scenarios, you can certainly play both of these. The power level is there to justify the loss in those cases (I'd much rather play this than the Torch Bearer) and you won't have to worry about moving them both. Otherwise, you can also consider swapping out the Banner of Strength for this in scenarios with lots of negative conditions that are removed by healing. That being said, while it is possible, it will still be awkward with your reduced attack values as well as giving up one of your ranged attacks while still having a 9-card hand size (so shorter rest cycles).",

					"bottom": "The bottom action, on the other hand, is rather niche. It helps to enable a really powerful combo at level 9 and otherwise can just be thrown down in single-room defence scenarios. But otherwise, if you're focused on using Banners, Banner of Strength is going to give you more value that's also easier to use most of the time. While Shield 1 against all enemies attacks is inherently more powerful than +1 Attack on one attack per character, the restriction of needing to keep this adjacent to whoever is taking those attacks for it to be effective is just too much work for it to be worth it in most scenarios.",

You actually lack a late initiative big move (the 67 on Tip of the Spear is not late enough to be reliable), so this fills that hole while providing a bunch of bonuses. The AoE Muddle lends itself well to AoEing a group of enemies who won't all die next round, and the Air is extremely free to power up Deflecting Manoeuvre.",

So yeah, if you take this card, you take it for the bottom action, which you'll be more than happy to use every single rest cycle, and then maybe in one out of every five times you play this card, you'll be able to set up the top and get an amazing payoff.</p>"

It's less that you're going to somehow put yourself in the middle of 5-6 enemies with an ally, and more having three extra hexes gives you more flexibility for targeting and will on average net you one additional target. Definitely a reasonable upgrade. Of course, that's not really what makes the card appealing.",
					"bottom": "The real deal on this card is the bottom action. It's difficult to really put into words just how profound this effect is. So many times, you'll find yourself or an ally just a tiny bit away from where you need everyone to be in order to pull off the pattern. This just makes that happen, routinely. And it's also just a lot of free movement for you and your allies over the course of the scenario. Give it a try and you'll see.

You should never really play this before the end of the scenario, but at the end, you'll be happy it's there.",

Between Explosive Epicenter and Boldening Blow, you have enough granted movement by now to make this happen. Unfortunately, there's often going to be a pretty real drawback as well - frequently one of your two allies that helps you with this pattern is going to be the Reinforcement. It will be focused over you because it's before you in initiative order, and Shield 1 isn't going to be enough to keep it alive. And both the Shield and the Wound lead this to wanting to be played early in a room's combat, which is obviously the worst time to have the Reinforcement die on you. Accordingly, I think this can be quite good if you're in a party with a number of other melee allies such that you don't need your trust summon to set this up. If you don't have enough melee allies who are consistently around you, then it's not going to be worth it. And while the payoffs seem like exactly what a tank would want, the tank build just isn't set up to provide enough movement to make this happen regularly (and even then, you'd be putting the allies you're tanking for in pretty risky spots to get the payoff).",
					"bottom": "The better action on Barricade by a reasonable margin is the bottom. This Banner is incredibly powerful - it's just a free Disarm every single round as long as you can keep it next to someone who will get attacked at least once in the round. That's not very difficult to do. And then it has some nice synergies with self-damage, like the Boneshaper's level 6 summon that makes her suffer six damage. It's so easy to set this up to negate that and that's such a huge swing for the Boneshaper.",
					"overall": "Accordingly, what are the use cases for actually taking Barricade at 6?<p>If you're going to spend a lot of time at level 9. The Banner of Valor is part of, in my opinion, the strongest Banner Spear build at level 9 (from the Banner build). I don't generally think this is worth it because giving up Bolstering Shout is a high cost until level 9. And if you take Barricade here, you're left with the choice of either just not using it at all, or swapping out the Banner of Strength for it, which makes you much weaker offensively. I don't think you can afford to go down to 8 cards without offensive tempo gains (except on short scenarios). Of course, if your party is very strong offensively but fragile, they may prefer you to bring more defence in the form of Valor over Strength anyway, in which case you can just make the swap. Similarly, if you have a Boneshaper who has the level 6 Skeleton summon card, you can consider this as well. In any of these cases, just treat Bolstering Shout as Barricade for the rest of the guide.</p>"

Javelin offered the same idea at level 1 but with only Move 1, was much more difficult to use. Here with Move 3 and an extra target, the utility is regularly there. And beyond that, the bottom can also be used to pull enemies away from your fragile allies.",

Attack 1 isn't very impressive, but by now you should have an excellent attack modifier deck, meaning the real value here is drawing three cards with obvious highlights like the rolling Shield or the Disarm. This bottom action really wants you to have Air as it makes the targeting so much easier.",

I just imagine the Banner Spear running up behind their ally, Immobilizing a bunch of enemies so they're stuck there continuing to hit their ally, all the while saying 'I'm helping! I'm helping!' The truth is, unless you have another tanky ally, this pattern is just pretty difficult to pull off. If you have a tanky ally who ends up surrounded by enemies, you can then run up behind them, use this, and then both of you back off thanks to Explosive Epicenter. Otherwise, you'll need to have a non-tanky ally run in first, then you go in after them and do the combo. The problem is that with most allies, you lack an initiative that makes this work conveniently. If they can go before 6 initiative, then it's actually very easy, so someone like a Blinkblade can make this work. But otherwise, you're likely going at something like 27 initiative, which just creates too great of a risk that the enemies will act before you and everything will end very poorly. And similarly, trying to do it at the end of the round, after the enemies have gone, doesn't really work either. You'll need your ally to go before you but after the enemies while you can only go as late as 73, so it really just doesn't come together. Accordingly, if you're playing a Spear build and have Explosive Epicenter as well as either an ally who can regularly go before 6 initiative or a tanky ally, you can do some really powerful stuff with this top action. Otherwise, it's pretty mediocre.",
					"bottom": "The good news for Sweeping Aid is that the bottom is actually just quite good. A Move 3 with four healing attached is always going to be good on any melee character, and splitting up the heals makes it a lot better for removing negative conditions. Now, how much better than Meat Grinder bottom is this really? Definitely better, although probably not the difference between level 2 and level 8 better. Although I think this says more about how great Meat Grinder bottom is at level 2 than necessarily being a condemnation of this at level 8.

Most of the time, there should be two to three times as many enemies as characters. Obviously summoners change the math and yes, once again, Banner of Strength is absurd with the Boneshaper. But otherwise, this is likely to deal around twice the damage of Banner of Strength.

The downside is that Banner of Strength can focus all of its damage into a single enemy in a round, whereas this is inherently split.",

					"top": "Even just playing Banner of Strength, this would be a non-loss Attack 11 once each rest cycle with a bit of an upside and downside (moving the Banner forward is helpful for traversal but risky for its survival). Of course, we want to do better than that. We really want to play Hail of Spears with two Banners, which gets us to an absurd non-loss Attack 15-16 per rest cycle. As discussed previously, sufficient offensive tempo like this can absolutely justify the significant reduction in stamina. Furthermore, the reduced stamina is actually a bit of a combo here: by going to very short rest cycles right away, we end up playing this action even more, which helps us to further dominate the scenario. Your second rest cycle will already only be three turns, which means you're looking at doing an Attack 15-16 every three turns on average for an entire scenario. That'll usually get the job done.<p>Now what is the best way to set up Hail of Spears? As I mentioned at level 6, the best combo is going to involve Banner of Valor alongside Banner of Courage. You summon Banner of Courage first, which means monsters focus it, which is great because then the Banner of Valor will negate the first attack on it, and it has quite high hp. And then the Shield provided from Banner of Courage will help protect Banner of Valor from multi-target attacks. As we're going to be putting our Banners in harm's way, this combination of two excellent defensive Banners is the best choice. You lose out on offense from the lack of Banner of Strength, but obviously that's easily compensated by now with the top of Hail of Spears. Unfortunately, when levelling up normally and not spending much time at level 9, I don't recommend taking Barricade at level 6, so you won't actually have the Banner of Valor. Accordingly, for most builds, you'll instead just use the Banners of Courage and Strength. Again, I'd generally recommend summoning Courage first just because it's tankier and if one of them has to die, you'd much rather it be Courage.</p>",
					"bottom": "And speaking of dying, should both of your Banners somehow die, you can resummon them in the last room for a desperate last couple of rounds with the bottom of Hail of Spears.

					"The single-summon build for the Boneshaper is probably the most traditional-Gloomhaven of the Boneshaper's builds, focused around getting out a strong loss melee summon and keeping it alive all scenario to deal damage. To keep it alive we'll need to use commanded movement, defensive tools to block damage (ability cards like Flesh Shield [level 4] or items like our starting item the Warden's Robes), and we'll even occasionally use Skeletons as decoys/buffers to draw enemy attacks such that our prized summon doesn't die."
				],
				"benefits": [
					"Your party typically lacks space in melee range of enemies. If you're playing in a larger party where your allies are mostly melee, you may find that it's difficult to have enough space next to enemies to deal damage with Skeletons. It will typically take two Skeletons to deal the damage of one loss melee summon so if you don't have that space, you'll be more effective focusing your attention on one, more effective, summon. It's worth noting that there are two types of melee allies. Some melee allies, like a Blinkblade, can kind of move all over the place and target any enemies. Allies like this don't really pose a problem because they can just fight the back line while you fight the front. On the other hand, melee Drifters or Bannerspears, for example, typically fight 'front-to-back,' which means that they kill what's directly in front of them until there's nothing else in front of them. You naturally also fight like this with your summons, so these are the types of allies who compete with you for space.",

					"Having at least one tanky ally. You do want a dedicated tank who can absorb hits to keep your loss summon alive.",
					"A crowd of melee allies. The more melee allies you have, within reason, the less likely your summon will randomly die.",

With two movement, flying, and the aforementioned three range, it's likely to attack pretty much every turn. Attack 1 may not seem like a lot, but getting one every round of combat, especially when paired with your natural ability to Poison a lot of enemies, adds up to a ton of damage over the course of a scenario with very minimal upkeep. Additionally, having this on the board gives you a backup target for your summon control attacks if your skeletons all somehow get killed before your turn.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also quite solid as a pretty free source of fire-and-forget damage. Admittedly, while you can just set it up and wait to get paid off whenever, it's significantly better when it triggers against certain enemy types (typically those with higher shield values). The worst part of the bottom is that you can't have both the bottom and the top.",

The Wraith is pretty bad against enemies with shield, while the bottom is very good against them. So lots of shield? Use the bottom. Little-to-no shield? Get that Wraith out there early. Either way, we're loving this card.</p>"

I have used, and seen used, this top action before, but it's certainly not common and will require some very specific circumstances (and typically a large party). So I mostly wouldn't worry about the top loss when considering this card and maybe it will pop up as being helpful here or there if you've already brought the card for its bottom action.",
					"bottom": "The bottom of Approach Oblivion is the real reason to bring this card. Some builds will want so much summon movement that they're willing to bring this card along just for that.

It's much, much less likely that we'll plan on using this as our attack for the turn and we won't be able to hit anything because of what happened before we went. The Dark consumption for Pierce 2 is also a very welcome bonus as we often struggle to deal with enemies with shield, especially at lower levels, and we have a couple of easy sources of Dark already at level 1.",
					"bottom": "The bottom loss is exactly how you want to set up single-use loss actions. Pairing a single-use loss with a spammable top means that we can have access to this loss for when we need at essentially zero opportunity cost. And this bottom loss is perfectly fine - an Attack 5 is certainly not a worthwhile loss as a top action, but as a bottom action at level 1 on a 12-card class, it's definitely acceptable. You'll be more than happy to use this on boss fights, in desperate situations, or at the end of scenarios. And do note that this can grant the attack to any ally, not just a summon.",

The limitations against the effectiveness of these summons, aside from the monsters themselves, is just your hit points (which are not very easy for you to replenish yourself) and enough space on the board for them to hit. Most builds on this class are going to focus around using these Skeletons in one way or another, and even the build that doesn't play them as its primary focus will still happily summon one from time to time for value.",

Long gone are the base Gloomhaven times of easily stacking 10 curses in the enemy attack modifier deck. As you have no top movement and you also don't typically even have significant personal positioning requirements (as you can command your summons from pretty much anywhere), it's not going to be common that you're within range 2 of two enemies. Most often, depending on my party and the scenario, I'll try to use this bottom action on turn 1 of a scenario and then rarely, if ever, play it after that. Of course, the top action is reason enough to bring this card, so we can focus on playing it for that and just be happy anytime we get to pull off the bottom with two targets.",

The conditional +1 Attack is not really something you should think about too much - if you hit an enemy with this before your summon gets next to them, you're getting the +1 Attack that way as well by virtue of your summon benefiting from the poison with their attack. And yes, poisoning enemies is extremely valuable to you given the number of smaller attacks you're likely to make with your summons.",

Enemies with retaliate are the bane of most summons, especially melee summons . Being able to go down to an 11-card summon-based class who can circumvent that issue is absolutely, positively worth it. So we'll be bringing this card to any scenario with a reasonable amount of retaliate and setting up the bottom when it's necessary.",
					"overall": "Oh sweet, sweet Decaying Will.<p>Obviously the bottom doesn't need to be played immediately in the scenario if you're not facing any of the enemies with retaliate in your current room, but remember that you should see all of the enemy types when setting up the scenario, and that information is going to be crucial for helping you figure out whether you need to bring this card or not. And worst-case, if you bring this card and there doesn't end up being a need for the bottom, you're just stuck with the very good top action, so it's a pretty great deal. I will note that it's happened much more often to me that I've tried to get away with not playing this when 'maybe I should but maybe I don't need to' and ended up regretting it than the opposite of having played it and not needing it in the end.</p>"

With a summon triggering an attack, obviously the top action is very, very good. And as has already been mentioned, we do certainly have some uses for Dark (and even more coming).",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, it should be pretty obvious that looting is going to be even more important in Frosthaven than it was in Gloomhaven and you won't naturally walk onto a lot of money as you stand pretty far back from combat, so having the ability to get one of your summons to snatch some loot for you is great.

That being said, it's not quite that simple as we do both need to give up a Skeleton and have the Skeleton in an appropriate location. Giving up a Skeleton can certainly be acceptable if you kill an enemy that would have killed the Skeleton anyway and with a big loss attack like this, that's not unrealistic. As for positioning the Skeleton, you'll most commonly want to combo this top with the bottom of Approach Oblivion. Regardless, the top of this card is not what makes me want to bring it.",
					"bottom": "It's also not necessarily the bottom action either. The bottom action is certainly interesting. Two AoE direct damage is quite good. The downside is that you're not super fast yourself with this (going at 21) so many of your allies will have gone before you. And all of your summons naturally go before you. So the greatest difficulty with this bottom is making sure you trigger it. Obviously you can set this up first then kill an enemy with a top command action - something like Command the Wretched - but 2-3 damage is often not going to be enough. Your melee allies also won't really appreciate triggering this for you. Of course, your summons are mostly melee but at the same time a 3-hp Skeleton and a 1-hp Skeleton are very similar in terms of effectiveness, so it's not the end of the world if they get a bit dinged up exploding some corpses. All-in-all, this is powerful and quite free to play but also harder to use than you would expect, making it fine but not great.",
					"overall": "Exploding Corpse is just fine.<p>We're not unhappy with this card just because of the initiative. At level 1, this is our second-fast initiative, just behind our 18. So while I'm not overly concerned about the value I'm going to get from the top action or bottom action here, just having this around to go at 21 initiative is going to be good enough, whether that's for a Move 2, to set up the bottom in the hopes of getting some free direct damage, or sometimes even to play the top. When you control 2-3 summons in addition to having your own turn, being able to go early in the round can be a huge swing, and definitely justifies making sure we bring some fast initiatives when we can.</p>"

Accordingly, it's not always easy for us to heal ourselves. Even this seemingly-mediocre self-heal is actually really, really welcome. Think about it like this: if you get an average of Heal 1.5 from this each rest cycle and you use it during six rest cycles, that's 4-5 additional Skeletons you'll be able to summon during the scenario. It really does add up. And don't overly focus on the bonus heal here, try to get it if you can, but the most important thing is just making sure you find the chance to play this more than anything, triggering the bonus regularly can be challenging.",

					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the biggest reason you won't use the top action more often on this card is because you'll want to use the bottom even more. Movement that also moves one of your summons is just great. Getting to go early, move a summon, and then use one of your slower top command attacks (especially the more powerful ones without movement tied to them - like Eternal Torment) to have that summon attack something it just approached is a very common and desirable turn.",
					"overall": "Flow of the Black River is, simply put, your best level 1 card. I'll just get it out of the way in the beginning this time: initiative, initiative, initiative. This is your fastest level 1 card and your second-fastest possible card before level 9. That alone makes this card incredibly important.

If you're desperate, sitting around at 1 or 2 hit points and you can't get anything going because you can't summon, you may be willing to play this with the level 1 summons sometimes. In those cases, it will be acceptable, although not exciting. Where this gets really interested is when you hit level 6 and can use this to negate the six damage, at which point you're looking at a loss Heal 10 self (or sometimes even Heal 14), which is certainly something this class can be in the market for. Unfortunately, by that time, you typically also already have a number of other losses you want to play, so I still only end up running that combo if my other losses don't look good in that scenario or the scenario is quite short.",

There's not much more to say about it than that: with one of your signature summons on top, a spammable and always-welcome Move 4 on bottom, and solid late initiative, this is definitely one of your best level 1 cards. The only catch with this card is that you need to be careful when evaluating your total movement for a scenario: obviously if you summon with the top action, you won't have access to this Move 4, so you need to consider that this won't be a big move ability for you as often as you think when building your hand."

In scenarios where you really need to start quickly, this top loss is actually quite reasonable to use in order to keep up with killing enemies while also deploying a summon to the board. With your hand size you can certainly afford it and it's often better to play a loss like this than try to be greedy, play too slow, take a bunch of damage and be stuck unable to summon afterwards. But after the first two turns, I'd pretty much just ignore the top action and just keep this card around for the bottom and its initiative.",
					"bottom": "The move ability on bottom is obviously generically useful, especially as the other Move 4 we just looked at is going to be played for its top action quite often.",
					"overall": "So Malicious Conversion is the card I personally bring instead of Dark Tidings. Dark Tidings has a better top loss and I'd rather a Move 4 rather than this Move 3-5, but initiative is king. The 26 initiative here may not seem great in the abstract but this is our third-fastest initiative at level 1 and we're a 12-card class. Additionally, Exploding Corpse isn't always easy to use. Every time I cut this card while playing at low levels, I regret it, getting into situations where I'd kill to have just one more 'fast enough' card. Trust me, it's worth bringing it."

With this top, you can always find an outlet for either element and sometimes both. With just one element I consider the effect good and certainly worth doing, with two elements it's excellent. And remember, both effects are more useful for you than many other classes: you'll almost always have allies to strengthen because you have your summons, and Poison adds a significant amount of damage for you as you make a lot of smaller hits with your Skeletons.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also very good, although more so for one specific build. First of all, this bottom is a net of three hit points and Dark as a bottom heal action, which is honestly amazing. The catch is that you have more difficulty healing yourself than most and if you're trying to summon numerous Skeletons, you have more need of hit points than most. Accordingly, while the effect is very powerful, it's merely an average action in Skeleton-based builds. For single-summon builds, where you don't summon many Skeletons, your hit points are a much less precious resource, and this functions more like a Heal 4 or 5, which is incredible.  It is, unfortunately, only let down by its terrible initiative, especially as you lack fast non-loss top combat actions at low level, meaning the turn you play this for its bottom action will usually be a risky one.",

				},
				{
					"id": "wrathoftheturnedearth",
					"top": "Curse is generally more valuable than +1 Attack and the Earth consumption here is let down by the fact that your most common source of Earth at level 1 is an attack that already poisons an enemy and you typically want to use that on an enemy before your summon approaches it, making re-poisoning the same enemy not a great value proposition. Obviously it can work out, but all of this to say that Eternal Torment is just generally the better version, and it makes Dark to boot. Still, if you're more interested in having one summon attack often rather than summoning a large army of summons, this has what you need. And in the single-summon build, this top really is quite good: your summon moves for the turn, performs an Attack 3, then you command it to attack with this and it performs an Attack 4. Attack 7 non-loss total for the turn at level 2 (the single-summon build goes from level 2) is pretty excellent.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is similarly quite good in a single-summon build and pretty poor outside of it (so really just a perfect card for that niche). Skeletons are disposable so you don't care that much about making sure they don't get into bad spots. Accordingly, they may take some unnecessary punishment, but that's normally not the end of the world to you. Setting up a loss to keep them alive when they may waste some number of charges is not really super appealing, although obviously it can still be very good against bosses. Lastly, the initiative isn't particularly useful for the bottom, but being able to go late when you want your beefy loss summon to run up and hit an enemy is nice, so the initiative can be useful for the top.",

					"bottom": "The bottom doesn't really matter, at least not until later, if you're taking this card for a single-summon build, and I don't think it's enough to take this for a Skeleton-based build. The problem is that the bottom is just kind of awkward for a number of reasons. You can't perfectly control where your summons go, making an AoE like this hard to aim. When the AoE is a top action, you can use a bottom move command to get the summon into position, but the only way to get this into position with a top action is to use something like Command the Wretched, but then you're also attacking before poisoning, which is again awkward. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, you don't have top in-combat actions with good initiative, meaning you'll need to do this late, but obviously it's better to poison enemies early in a round so that your party can take advantage of it. All-in-all, this is a very powerful effect for a level 2 non-loss action, but the power level is significantly balanced out by the awkwardness of using it.",
					"overall": "Unearthed Horror is the key card for the single-summon build at levels 2-4. It might not seem at a glance like it's really that much better than a Skeleton, but consider that most of your attacking consists of commanding summons to attack."

If your Skeletons are going to take a significant number of hits in the scenario because you don't have allies on the front line absorbing hits for them, this will pretty much always pay for itself to an excellent degree. Now tanking hits with Skeletons feels great - you're getting disarms and retaliate damage from your summons.

This persistent loss is the basis for an entire build on this class and I think that build is very, very good in many parties.",

It is the core card for my favourite build, although that's the bottom.<p>The initiative is actually very welcome as well, not just that it's another in the 20's, but I've mentioned over and over how we don't have any fast top combat actions, and now we can have one of those, even if 28 isn't stellar, which will make many of our bottom actions better.</p>"

Even with the more realistic Skeleton + Wraith, we're still looking at a non-loss Attack 5 that can hit multiple targets and benefits from our proclivity towards poison. Dark isn't free but obviously the payoff is high enough here and we certainly can make it, so we can plan around having it if we take this card. Definitely tempting.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom persistent loss is extremely spicy but also takes some work to truly get there. If you have the right tools, Critical Failure bottom is certainly worth building around, although we can't assume anyone here will have those tools.",
					"overall": "This is a decent card with a usable top and a very niche bottom loss.<p>What are the conditions for the bottom loss? There are three primary things I'd look for:<p><ol> <li>Will you be level 8 for a reasonable amount of time? Your best cursing ability is at level 8 and a decent one is at level 7. If you have access to that, you're already pretty close to getting there with this.</li> <li>A +1 Range enhancement on the bottom of Damned Horde. That enhancement makes it pretty realistic to get two more curses per rest cycle.</li> <li>An ally (or allies) who curse. Obviously if we can't really get there ourself, if we have some help to bridge the gap between ~5 curses and 8-10, we can justify this.</li> <p>If you have any two of the three above, I would seriously consider taking Critical Failure and building around the bottom in a Skeleton Swarm build.</p>"

					"id": "fleshshield",
					"top": "Flesh Shield's top gives you a way to dump either element like with Transfer of Essence at level 1, only here we get to do it and go quickly. The biggest draw of playing the top will be getting to do an in-combat top action with blazing (for a Boneshaper) initiative. But it's also just a powerful effect - if you have a tank or tanky ally in your party, giving them this for the turn, with one or even zero elements, can bridge the gap to them being just tanky enough for the round.",
					"bottom": "And as the bottom is at its best in a single-summon build, and single-summon builds are what we're likely to do if we have a tank in the party, the pairing is just smooth. You'll definitely use the bottom action a lot more than the top in most parties, but when you do use the top, it will usually have a big impact. And yeah, the bottom is just great. Getting to go this early in the round and guarantee that one of your summons will survive at least one hit is something every summoner would be happy to have. Obviously it does come with a serious cost - at least for a Skeleton build - but as it's the same cost as just summoning another Skeleton, this is still like getting to summon an in-position Skeleton with a bottom action, which is great. And then in the single-summon build, this is even better. That build cares a lot more about keeping its summons alive and the hit point cost is also much less significant, making this bottom action one of our best actions for that build at any level.",
					"overall": "Flesh Shield is… difficult to live without. Why? This is our fastest possible initiative until level 9. Our 18 initiative was already invaluable and this 16 added to that just makes a world of difference."

					"top": "Our upgrade to the Raging Corpse has two more hit points and applies Wound on each of its attacks. Innate Wound is certainly a significant damage boost even if sometimes it will be wasted because the summon hits the same enemy twice in a round. And the two extra hit points do matter quite a bit as enemy levels have increased, making it more realistic for the summon to survive a couple of hits. Overall a very solid improvement.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom would be great for a Skeleton-based build as it's actually some very efficient self-healing. Unfortunately for the bottom action, the other card at level 5 is just too good to pass up for Skeletons and thus this bottom, despite being genuinely good, doesn't have a real place to occupy in any builds.",
					"overall": "Unforgivable Methods is the new core summon for the single-summon build."
				},
				{
					"id": "solidbones",
					"top": "Increased hit points for Skeletons makes them more likely to be able to function as a double-disarm as well as increasing the chance they get another attack off before dying, thereby increasing damage. Increasing their movement also increases their damage by reducing the chance that the Skeleton gets blocked up and can't reach a target to hit. And shield is common enough (and a significant enough issue for Skeleton builds) that pierce as also welcome damage. This just makes Skeletons a lot better at what they do, which is essentially what you do, all at the cost of going from 12 cards to 11, which is a steal. The biggest downside is just needing another turn to set this up as it competes with Skeleton summons directly for your top action economy (another reason Grave Digging and, to a lesser extent, Bone Dagger are looking so good).",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom is just a fine spammable action for any scenario where you don't want to play the top or don't want to play the top right away. Why wouldn't you play the top? Well, if all the enemies are likely to hit for four or more damage, the added hit points aren't likely to do much. If there's no shield, obviously the pierce doesn't do anything. The movement is more difficult to evaluate generally and that's just a case-by-case thing. All of this to say: while Solid Bones is amazing to have active, you shouldn't just throw it up every single scenario without thinking about it - there will be some scenarios (or points in a build) where it's not worth playing, even if not many. And for those times, the bottom is fine, if not nearly as good as the bottom of Unforgivable Methods.",

Additionally, it can even save us some stamina by letting us have more Skeletons out for less active cards at the end of a rest cycle. Now obviously this great power also comes with great cost and losing six hit points is a huge cost. You'll definitely want to try to grab some healing items or if your allies can give you a timely Ward before you do this, it would be great. If you don't have access to much healing or Ward in your available items and allies, you should seriously consider using Life in Death's bottom then to help pay for this (activate that bottom the turn you summon this the first time, then try to do just one more summon with it and then this again if you can, although even if you just use it for this and then two normal summons that's also okay).",
					"bottom": "The bottom… just can't compare. At least not for a Skeleton-based build. For a single-summon build, this is just a substantially better version of a card we're already using in Approach Oblivion, so there it's obviously not bad, if nothing special. And for either a single-summon build or Skeleton Swarm build that goes the route of the Bone Ball, this bottom can be useful after the Bone Ball has been filled with Skeletons, to make it move for your command attack actions.",
					"overall": "Well, we thought that level 5 would be a high point for Skeleton builds with Solid Bones, and then came along Rotting Multitude. Rotting Multitude's top summon action is crazy good. By far one of the biggest weaknesses of the Boneshaper is tempo and the amount of time it takes us to get set up or to re-setup after our summons die."

And the Dark generated here also just pairs very well with Wretched Command as a follow-up against any enemies with shield.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile the bottom is just a solid Boneshaper attack for when you don't need or want to command your summon or if you really need the poison (and get a nice free curse in the mix).",
					"overall": "Twisted Decree is also just quite solid in the same way that Wretched Command was solid at level 1.<p>Good top action, good bottom action, and a good late initiative makes for an overall good card. Not quite on the same level as Rotting Multitude for the builds that want Skeletons, but a welcome addition nonetheless.</p>"

				{
					"id": "recycledlimbs",
					"top": "Recycled Limbs top provides a swingy loss that's very situation-specific. As I said, the Boneshaper struggles with the time it takes to set up and then re-setup and Recycled Limbs can help enormously with the latter. With a single Skeleton summon active, you can get back another (one of the two being Rotting Multitude) and then immediately get three Move 3, Attack 3 Pierce 1's. Getting that amount of immediate tempo while also recreating your summon presence on the board all with a single action is quite the useful tool to have, even if it's hopefully something you won't necessarily need or want to use every scenario. The most difficult part of the top is just getting both the elements at the right moment for when you need this - it's something you can do, but it'll be much more smooth if you have an item or ally to help out a bit.",
					"bottom": "And while you're waiting to need the top, the bottom is just a great consistent value engine. First of all, note that this triggers on the death of any 'figure', which means it triggers on your Skeletons dying. Accordingly, this will easily trigger three times per rest cycle, making this action three instances of Heal 2, Range 3 on an ally that you can just fire-and-forget. And it also makes Dark, which is always welcome. It might not seem impressive, but trust me that once you've played with it some amount, the amount of healing your party gets from this one card for such a low cost is really very welcome (this helps justify asking any allies who can heal to target you so much - now you can give something back!).",

The biggest drawback to this top action is simply that it competes with your Skeleton summoning, which are also top setup actions. Naturally some combination of the two works quite well because once you have some Skeletons on the board, a significantly increased miss chance for the enemies means your Skeletons will stick around longer and be more effective.",
					"bottom": "Soul Claim bottom is just a significantly upgraded version of the acceptable-but-not-impressive Bone Dagger bottom: no range requirement, we get the summon in what is typically a more useful position, and we get to set this up with better initiative.",
					"overall": "Soul Claim doesn't offer anything quite as impressive as Recycled Limbs but just gives two decent actions with a good initiative, and if you've learned anything by now, that's something we're often in for.<p>When you have Soul Claim in your hand, there's really not a dominant side that you'll end up using more often than not, you'll just have a nice filler card that can provide you with a top or bottom action carrying reasonable initiative whenever you want - and there's a lot to be said for a card like that.</p>"

What's even more awesome is that it's not only an awesome design but it's also really, really good. It does demand a lot of work though: you need to keep it safe and sufficiently fed, which requires a ton of summon command movement both to keep it in a good spot and to get stray Skeletons to join the Horde. But once you reach a comfortable stack of tokens on this, it just destroys enemies while also being pretty well-protected from disaster. The biggest catch is that you just need time and space to set up.",
					"bottom": "I'm not even sure this card has a bottom action. In truth, it's okay-ish for a single-summon build if for some reason you don't feel that you can summon the top right away, but the Bone Ball waits for no man (or aesther).",
					"overall": "BONE BALL!<p>Bone Ball note: Skeletons will essentially treat the hex occupied by the Bone Ball as an unoccupied hex and if their movement, following normal focus rules, ends in that hex then they will be eaten.

The Dark consumption here isn't something you really need to play around - sure it makes the curses more likely to be drawn, but it's not really enough of a difference that I'll care that much to set it up in advance, with the exception being on the Bone Wall build, where the added mitigation matters a lot more because of the goal of our build. Even more than that, the muddle is especially useful if you did choose to play around Critical Failure (level 4) as it will keep ranged enemies from backing away from your Skeletons before attacking, meaning your Skeletons will get to attack them if they draw a curse.",

Even without Earth, getting a Move 3, Heal 3, Range 3 targeting an ally is just always welcome, and when you can toss them a Ward too it's even better.<p>I'm never looking to pay too much attention to this bottom because of how powerful the top is, but if you somehow get to the end of a rest cycle without finding a time to use the top, you'll happily throw down the bottom for some free value, and that's just a great way to put together a card.</p>",

In this build, because we know our summons will get smacked around quite a bit, we're going to lean into it and actually benefit from our Skeletons getting hit. Instead of a pure damage-dealer, we're going to function as a hybrid between a damage-dealer and a tank."

					"Your allies really benefit from poison. This build may be one of the best builds for any class in any Gloomhaven game at applying poison to most enemies in the scenario. So if you have allies who make a large number of small attacks (like some Blinkblade builds do, for example), this build may be your best way of being effective for the party."

With two movement, flying, and the aforementioned three range, it's likely to attack pretty much every turn. Attack 1 may not seem like a lot, but getting one every round of combat, especially when paired with your natural ability to Poison a lot of enemies, adds up to a ton of damage over the course of a scenario with very minimal upkeep. Additionally, having this on the board gives you a backup target for your summon control attacks if your skeletons all somehow get killed before your turn.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is also quite solid as a pretty free source of fire-and-forget damage. Admittedly, while you can just set it up and wait to get paid off whenever, it's significantly better when it triggers against certain enemy types (typically those with higher shield values).

					"overall": "Angry Spirits is an excellent card.<p>The good news is that it's usually pretty easy to figure out which half you should be using depending on the enemies you're facing in the scenario. The Wraith is pretty bad against enemies with shield, while the bottom is very good against them. So lots of shield? Use the bottom. Little-to-no shield? Get that Wraith out there early.

So I mostly wouldn't worry about the top loss when considering this card and maybe it will pop up as being helpful here or there if you've already brought the card for its bottom action.",
					"bottom": "The bottom of Approach Oblivion is the real reason to bring this card. Some builds will want so much summon movement that they're willing to bring this card along just for that.

It's much, much less likely that we'll plan on using this as our attack for the turn and we won't be able to hit anything because of what happened before we went. The Dark consumption for Pierce 2 is also a very welcome bonus as we often struggle to deal with enemies with shield, especially at lower levels, and we have a couple of easy sources of Dark already at level 1.",
					"bottom": "The bottom loss is exactly how you want to set up single-use loss actions. Pairing a single-use loss with a spammable top means that we can have access to this loss for when we need at essentially zero opportunity cost. And this bottom loss is perfectly fine - an Attack 5 is certainly not a worthwhile loss as a top action, but as a bottom action at level 1 on a 12-card class, it's definitely acceptable. You'll be more than happy to use this on boss fights, in desperate situations, or at the end of scenarios. And do note that this can grant the attack to any ally, not just a summon.",

The limitations against the effectiveness of these summons, aside from the monsters themselves, is just your hit points (which are not very easy for you to replenish yourself) and enough space on the board for them to hit. Most builds on this class are going to focus around using these Skeletons in one way or another, and even the build that doesn't play them as its primary focus will still happily summon one from time to time for value.",
					"bottom": "Meanwhile, the bottom action is actually worse than it seems, although that's not a bad thing. Long gone are the base Gloomhaven times of easily stacking 10 curses in the enemy attack modifier deck. As you have no top movement and you also don't typically even have significant personal positioning requirements (as you can command your summons from pretty much anywhere), it's not going to be common that you're within range 2 of two enemies. Most often, depending on my party and the scenario, I'll try to use this bottom action on turn 1 of a scenario and then rarely, if ever, play it after that. Of course, the top action is reason enough to bring this card, so we can focus on playing it for that and just be happy anytime we get to pull off the bottom with two targets.",

And yes, poisoning enemies is extremely valuable to you given the number of smaller attacks you're likely to make with your summons.",

Enemies with retaliate are the bane of most summons, especially melee summons . Being able to go down to an 11-card summon-based class who can circumvent that issue is absolutely, positively worth it.

And worst-case, if you bring this card and there doesn't end up being a need for the bottom, you're just stuck with the very good top action, so it's a pretty great deal. I will note that it's happened much more often to me that I've tried to get away with not playing this when 'maybe I should but maybe I don't need to' and ended up regretting it than the opposite of having played it and not needing it in the end.</p>"

That being said, it's not quite that simple as we do both need to give up a Skeleton and have the Skeleton in an appropriate location. Giving up a Skeleton can certainly be acceptable if you kill an enemy that would have killed the Skeleton anyway and with a big loss attack like this, that's not unrealistic. As for positioning the Skeleton, you'll most commonly want to combo this top with the bottom of Approach Oblivion. Regardless, the top of this card is not what makes me want to bring it.",
					"bottom": "It's also not necessarily the bottom action either. The bottom action is certainly interesting. Two AoE direct damage is quite good. The downside is that you're not super fast yourself with this (going at 21) so many of your allies will have gone before you. And all of your summons naturally go before you. So the greatest difficulty with this bottom is making sure you trigger it. Obviously you can set this up first then kill an enemy with a top command action - something like Command the Wretched - but 2-3 damage is often not going to be enough. Your melee allies also won't really appreciate triggering this for you. Of course, your summons are mostly melee but at the same time a 3-hp Skeleton and a 1-hp Skeleton are very similar in terms of effectiveness, so it's not the end of the world if they get a bit dinged up exploding some corpses. All-in-all, this is powerful and quite free to play but also harder to use than you would expect, making it fine but not great.",
					"overall": "Exploding Corpse is just fine.<p>We're not unhappy with this card just because of the initiative. At level 1, this is our second-fast initiative, just behind our 18. So while I'm not overly concerned about the value I'm going to get from the top action or bottom action here, just having this around to go at 21 initiative is going to be good enough, whether that's for a Move 2, to set up the bottom in the hopes of getting some free direct damage, or sometimes even to play the top. When you control 2-3 summons in addition to having your own turn, being able to go early in the round can be a huge swing, and definitely justifies making sure we bring some fast initiatives when we can.</p>"

Think about it like this: if you get an average of Heal 1.5 from this each rest cycle and you use it during six rest cycles, that's 4-5 additional Skeletons you'll be able to summon during the scenario. It really does add up. And don't overly focus on the bonus heal here, try to get it if you can, but the most important thing is just making sure you find the chance to play this more than anything, triggering the bonus regularly can be challenging.",

In those cases, it will be acceptable, although not exciting. Where this gets really interested is when you hit level 6 and can use this to negate the six damage, at which point you're looking at a loss Heal 10 self (or sometimes even Heal 14), which is certainly something this class can be in the market for. Unfortunately, by that time, you typically also already have a number of other losses you want to play, so I still only end up running that combo if my other losses don't look good in that scenario or the scenario is quite short.",

The only catch with this card is that you need to be careful when evaluating your total movement for a scenario: obviously if you summon with the top action, you won't have access to this Move 4, so you need to consider that this won't be a big move ability for you as often as you think when building your hand."

					"bottom": "The bottom is also very good, although more so for one specific build. First of all, this bottom is a net of three hit points and Dark as a bottom heal action, which is honestly amazing. The catch is that you have more difficulty healing yourself than most and if you're trying to summon numerous Skeletons, you have more need of hit points than most. Accordingly, while the effect is very powerful, it's merely an average action in Skeleton-based builds. For single-summon builds, where you don't summon many Skeletons, your hit points are a much less precious resource, and this functions more like a Heal 4 or 5, which is incredible.  It is, unfortunately, only let down by its terrible initiative, especially as you lack fast non-loss top combat actions at low level, meaning the turn you play this for its bottom action will usually be a risky one.",

Obviously it can work out, but all of this to say that Eternal Torment is just generally the better version, and it makes Dark to boot. Still, if you're more interested in having one summon attack often rather than summoning a large army of summons, this has what you need. And in the single-summon build, this top really is quite good: your summon moves for the turn, performs an Attack 3, then you command it to attack with this and it performs an Attack 4. Attack 7 non-loss total for the turn at level 2 (the single-summon build goes from level 2) is pretty excellent.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is similarly quite good in a single-summon build and pretty poor outside of it (so really just a perfect card for that niche). Skeletons are disposable so you don't care that much about making sure they don't get into bad spots. Accordingly, they may take some unnecessary punishment, but that's normally not the end of the world to you. Setting up a loss to keep them alive when they may waste some number of charges is not really super appealing, although obviously it can still be very good against bosses. Lastly, the initiative isn't particularly useful for the bottom, but being able to go late when you want your beefy loss summon to run up and hit an enemy is nice, so the initiative can be useful for the top.",

					"bottom": "The bottom doesn't really matter, at least not until later, if you're taking this card for a single-summon build, and I don't think it's enough to take this for a Skeleton-based build. The problem is that the bottom is just kind of awkward for a number of reasons. You can't perfectly control where your summons go, making an AoE like this hard to aim. When the AoE is a top action, you can use a bottom move command to get the summon into position, but the only way to get this into position with a top action is to use something like Command the Wretched, but then you're also attacking before poisoning, which is again awkward. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, you don't have top in-combat actions with good initiative, meaning you'll need to do this late, but obviously it's better to poison enemies early in a round so that your party can take advantage of it. All-in-all, this is a very powerful effect for a level 2 non-loss action, but the power level is significantly balanced out by the awkwardness of using it.",

The damage value from this attack makes it easily worth losing a Skeleton.",

If your Skeletons are going to take a significant number of hits in the scenario because you don't have allies on the front line absorbing hits for them, this will pretty much always pay for itself to an excellent degree. Now tanking hits with Skeletons feels great - you're getting disarms and retaliate damage from your summons.

Obviously if we can't really get there ourself, if we have some help to bridge the gap between ~5 curses and 8-10, we can justify this.</li> <p>If you have any two of the three above, I would seriously consider taking Critical Failure and building around the bottom in a Skeleton Swarm build.</p>"

And shield is common enough (and a significant enough issue for Skeleton builds) that pierce as also welcome damage.

The amount of damage enemies deal is really going to be the most important thing to consider. Obviously the upside of having most of our Skeletons get hit twice before dying in many scenarios is worth the fact that we don't use this top action all the time. But just remember that if you're facing enemies that hit for mostly 4+ damage, it's probably not worth playing the top for that scenario specifically in this build (because we care less about the +1 move and the pierce 1).<p>Solid Bones replaces Command the Wretched. As we're using our Skeletons in this build more as meat shields and less as offensive tools (although we still like them to attack on their turns), command attack actions are less important and we need a lot of our top actions for playing Solid Bones, Angry Spirits, and (re-)summoning Skeletons. Accordingly, Command, while still a solid card, makes the most sense to cut. Also, about the number of losses we're playing: I'd generally avoid going above three persistent losses, so pay attention to whether Solid Bones, Angry Spirits, or Decaying Will are played for their loss or not depending on the scenario (their other halves are still fine either way).</p>"

					"top": "Well, if you thought Like the Wind's bottom could move tokens back, it has gotten usurped pretty quickly. This is the kind of action that looks super gimmicky and for a ranged build these are free tokens as it is considered a melee attack therefore we won't be using any Precision Aim tokens. It's even pretty reasonable on other builds who are okay wading in close to enemies, simply to flip modifiers and move back a bunch of tokens.",
					"bottom": "The bottom is a nice situational Persistent Loss that could definitely put in a lot of work, although my primary concern is the best enemies to do True Damage to in base Gloomhaven were all squishy, high shielded ranged enemies, who typically have no reason to enter a hex adjacent to you. Not a bad thing to have available with how spammable the top action is, however.",
					"overall": "For a ranged drifter this top is not going to see the same token gain as a melee build as we are not expecting to be close to the front line, but it is possible to get some use out of it. The bottom is not something we will be playing."

					"id": "inevitableconsequences",
					"top": "This is definitely a pretty spicy top action, and I like that moving the token forwards to gain Immobilize will often be an easy choice, as it's usually easy to visualize whether or not Immobilize will actually impact the enemies this turn. This is definitely a build-dependant Loss, as you need to be able to move your Use Tokens back quickly after this kind of effect, but something like an Attack 5 Range 3 (with Precision Aim) Immobilize 4-5 targets is obviously great. What will ultimately determine this cards usability is how generally useful the bottom action is.",
					"bottom": "Well, as good as this bottom action is, it remains to be seen how often the (presumably) Ranged Drifter who wants the top action will be able to start their turn adjacent to a monster to perform an Attack 3 Poison. This, again, feels like a split card (much like Fierce Barrage at level 3), where the top action favours one build and the bottom favours the typically opposite build. This is a huge knock against the card when the other level 8 is so universally useful.",

					"top": "The top action is definitely neat and has some obviously cool synergy with Shield actions, however in practice by Level 9 I feel like you get hit a lot more for 5+ than 1-4 damage, so it is pretty specialized in that sense. It's also awkward that it doesn't save you from the actions you are most likely to have to lose a card to, especially unexpected 2x's drawn by a monster or an untimely Brittle.",
					"bottom": "Adding an extra target to a Heal 3 Range 3 Regenerate Strengthen is pretty incredible value, and any action that can Self Strengthen repeatedly (especially when tied to other effects) is going to have my attention. This isn't the strongest action for a level 9 in the world, but it's likely going to be a workhorse.",
					"overall": "This card is a bit underwhelming for a level 9 the top is short duration with only 4 slots, though the effect can be powerful on a tank who has other damage mitigation sources so it may not proc that often.<p>The bottom is a good support action, let down by the very late initiative which means that the ally will have gone before this action is played.</p>"

				{
					"id": "useeverypart",
					"top": "Use Every Part's top action is pretty absurd with the right coordination and positioning from your teammates, and it's hard to find fault with such an efficient action. it's good for nearly any archetype of Drifter, although obviously some are going to be more excited about it than others. Healing potentially multiple allies for 4 while dealing a pretty good amount of damage, and is another action that pairs well with Fierce Barrage's bottom.",
					"bottom": "The bottom action definitely has a combo-sort of feel to it, as just like Just the Wind before it, this is the kind of action where you want to dump everything into movi'double dip' on the Move and Attack values both being modified by many of Drifters persistent abilities.",
					"overall": "One of the best things about this card is the 18 initiative, it is the fastest we can get and that counts for a lot. Having another ranged attack with the added bonus of healing is a powerful combination."

								"comment": "I'll put this in the 4th potion slot because your 4th small slot should open up by the time you're level 7. At that point, you'll have access to Tri-Thrust, which makes the Major Power Potion now exceptional for you, being able to use it on a turn where you play this bottom and an AoE top for 8-12 bonus damage. And then it obviously gets even better at level 9."

								"comment": "Alright, I suppose we'll take a second Muscle Potion with the Vigor Potion. It's basically just overpaying for another Muscle Potion and you really shouldn't worry about getting bonus targets, just focus on using it at the right moment. But even an overpriced Muscle Potion is still very good."
